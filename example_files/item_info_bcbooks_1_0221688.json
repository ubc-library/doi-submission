Mr. Truteh, Surveyor General of British Columbia, on the evening of the 10th April instant, at the\nEussell House, Ottawa. . The dinner was\nparticipated in by Ministers and by members of both Houses, who, having aided\nin the work of Union, met together to\ncongratulate each other upon what they\nhad accomplished, and to do honour to\nour new sister Colony in the person of her\nrepresentative. Among those who were present were many who, in various capacities,\nhave been warm supporters of that policy\nwhich has resulted in the practical admission of British Columbia and ^the extension\nof the boundaries of the Dominion to the far\naway shores of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe large dining room was decorated in a\nvery tasteful manner with flags, evergreens,\nand appropriate mottoes; among \"the latter\nwe noticed\n\"Westward the march of Empire takes its\nway.\"\n\"The Star of Empire glitters in the \"West.\"\n\"One Queen, one Flag, one Destiny, one\nEmpire.\"\n\"British Connection.\"\n\"Vis unita Fortior.\"\n\"Quis separabit ?\"\n\"A Pacific Kail way.\"\n\" Ontario ;\" '' Quebec ;\" \" New Brunswick;\"\nI Nova Scotia;\" \" Manitoba ;\" ■\" British Columbia ;\" together with several others.\nGowan's band was in attendance in the\ngallery, and did much to promote the enjoyment of the evening by the performance of\nsome excellent music.\nAt eight o'clock the guests walked into\nthe hall to the number of about 200, and\nseated themselves at the tables.\nThe chair was occupied by Sir G. E. Car-\ntier. On his right was Mr. Truteh, and on\nhis left, Hon. Mr. Cockburn, Speaker of the\nHouse of Commons.    The  vice chairs were\noccupied by Mr. Angus Morrison, M.P., and\nMr. Alonzo Wright, MP.\n.When justice had been done to the very\nexcellent dinner provided, the chairman rose\nand proposed the first toast, which was drunk\nwith the usual loyal honors.\nI The Queen.\"\nBand—\" God save the Queen.\"\nThe next toast was \" the Prince and Princess of Wales and the rest of the Boyal\nFamily.\"\nBand—\" The Bed White and Blue.\"\nSir G. E.~Cabtier then proposed the Army,\nNavy, and Volunteers. He might be considered as too intimately connected with the\nlatter to propose a toast of the kind with\npropriety, but he might, at all events, say\nthat the volunteers of Canada had on more\nthan one occasion during the past few years\nbeen called upon to defend their country and\nthey had done so bravely and nobly, and like\npatriotic men (cheers).\nBand—\" British Grenadiers.\"\nLt-Col. Chamberun, C.M.G., in response to\nan unanimous call responded, saying that he\nthanked the company most heartily for the\nhonor done to the volunteers. In presence.\nof the chief of the Canadian Navy and also of\nan officer of the British regular army (Captain Cameron) he could not say anything on\nbehalf of those branches of the service, but\nspeaking for the volunteers he could,without\nany hesitation, testify to the gratification\nthey experienced at having the services which\nthey had rendered in defence of the Empire\nso heartily recognized, and also at finding\ntheir brother volunteers and fellow subjects,\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific, united with\nthem in the glorious privilege of defending\nthe flag of the Empire.    (Cheers.)\nCaptain Cameron was also called upon\nto respond. He said he regretted that a\ndistinguished volunteer officer like Colonel\nChamberlin had not undertaken to speak on.\nbehalf of the regular army- as well as for the\nvolunteers. He alluded to the Imperial\npolicy of withdrawing the troops from Can a- da, and to the doubts which that policy seem-1\ned to have given rise to in the minds of Canadians.   These doubts are very painful toi\nImperial officers, who know perfectly well\nthat the old English heart still beats beneath\nthe English breast. (Cheers.)   The Imperial\nGovernment- had  a right to withdraw the\ntroops from Canada, and to pursue a policy |\nof concentration  which   any military man\nwould say was a wise one.   But Britain would\nnot forget her children. (Cheers.)\nCommodore Forth? replied on behalf of the\nNavy. He said he was not a member of the\nBoyal navy, but only of the Provincial\nnavy, which was a comparatively small\naffair. Still it must be remembered that a\nnavy did not consist in ships alone, but in\nthe bone and muscle of its sailors, and in\nthe eighty thousand fishermen whom Canada possessed lay the strength of the Canadian navy.   (Cheers.)\nHon. Mr. Mitchell also replied on behalf of\nthe navy. He said that the events of the\npast years had shown that the navy of Canada was of some account, and as for the Royal\nNavy that great and glorious service which\nhas done so much to uphold the honor of the\nEmpire for years past, its fame was world\nwide.    (Cheers.;\nSir George E. Cartier then rose and said\nhe had now to propose the toast of the even-\nin et, \"Our Guest •' the Honorable Mr. Truteh.\nBefore doing so, however, he hoped to be allowed to make a few observations. Lust\nyear we achieved a great deal in extending\nthe boundaries of the Dominion a» far as the\nRocky Mountains. That was a great and\ndifficult work to accomplish, but it was merely an extension of the territorial limits of the\nDominion. Now they had achieved a greater\nwork, they had carried the limits of Canada\nas far as they could go in a westerly direction,\nand the end attained was worth the struggle.\n(Cheers.) Since Mr. Truteh had been in\nCanada he bad won many friends, but he\n(Sir George Carrier) and his colleagues bad\nbetter opportunities than any one else to\nform a more intimate acquaintance with him,\nand British Columbia, he was quite sure, could\nnot have a better representative. He regretted that the two gentlemen who accompanied him as delegates last summer were not\nwith him. Still, he could not help feeling\nthat they enjoyed a great pleasure in having\nMr. Trntch, one of the leading members of\nthe British Columbia Executive-Council, present with them (cheers). We have had our\nstruggle and are now rejoicing over our success, but we must not forget that Mr. Truteh\nand his colleagues have been battling for\nUnion for years. Our triumph was his\ntriumph also, and it was our duty to congratulate and do honour to him (cheers).\nHe (Sir George Cartier) could not forget that\n300 years ago a bold navigator set sail westward to discover a way to the eastern coast\nof Asia. His name was Jacques Cartier\n(cheers). He was followed by Champlain\nand La Salle, and when the latter left the\nplace where now stands the village of La-\nchine, seven miles from Montreal, he said as\nhe sailed westward that he was \"off for\nChina.\" The Canada of which these early\nsettlers dreamed was not a Lower Canada,\nbut a Canada that should really extend to\nChina (cheers). The Canada which we are\nestablishing to-day is the Canada which they\ndesired to see, one that should extend from\nocean to ocean (cheers).\nBand—\" For he's a jolly good fellow.\"\nMr. Teutch then rose and replied as follows :—\nI thank you most heartily, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, for the great honour\nyou have to-night conferred on British\nColumbia through her representative, and\nmy personal acknowledgments are especially due to you, Sir, for the flattering\nterms in which you have spoken of me. I\nam well aware that I am all undeserving of\nthe high encomiums which your politeness\nhas led you to bestow on me. As an Englishman—a loyal British subject—and as a true\nfriend of Briti.sh Columbia, the home of my\nadoption for the past 12 years, my heart has\nbeen thoroughly in the work of extending\nthe Dominion of Canada to the Pacific. But\nI can assume no other merit than this—if\nindeed there can be any merit in the performance of a simple and most pleasurable duty—\nthat I have laboured earnestly under the direction of our most excellent and able Governor, Mr. Musgrave, to promote that great object now so happily attained. But it is not\nthe less gratifying to me, sir, to be the recipient of the cordial welcome extended here\nto-night to British Columbia in the person of\nher representative on her entrance into this\nCon federation of British North America ; a\nwelcome which, I can assure you, will be\nmost gratefully appreciated in that country,\nand cannot fail to draw closer the bonds of\nunion between our community and the people of Canada. Well knowing as I do that I\nam expressing the sentiments of joyful gratitude which possess the entire British population of our colony at this moment, I tender\ntheir thanks to those gentlemen whose votes\nhave secured for us the consummation of our\nhopes and aspirations ; and I congratulate\nyou, Mr. Chairman, and your honourable colleagues in the Dominion Government, on\nyour far-sighted statemanship in bringing\nthis measure, so entirely in accord with the\nclearly enunciated wishes of the Imperial\nGovernment, to a successful issue, undeterred\nby the strenuous opposition urged against it -\nand I confidently express my belief, that as\nthe true merits of this measure are more\nthoroughly understood, as the baselessness\nand fallacy of the objections to the terms of\nour Union, and particularly to the railway\nengagement, are realized throughout the\ncountry, the policy of your Government will\nbe more and more generally and thankfully\nsustained.   (Cheers.)\nTHE  OPPOSITION*  FROM  OXTARIO.\nIt would ill become me, Sir, a  stranger\noccupying the position I do, to offer any 5\ncriticism   hostile  to   the   action   of  those\nwho placed themselves in antagonism to this\nmeasure.   I can fully believe that those gentlemen took that position in the conscientious discharge of their duty.   But having\nlistened to the whole of the debate on this\nsubject, having taken part in the arrangement of the terms  discussed,   and having\nspecial local acquaintance with the facts involved, I think I may be permitted, indeed I\nconsider it my duty, to comment on some of\nthe objections and arguments urged against\nthe passage of this measure, with the view of\nremoving   misapprehension.     And   in   the\nfirst place I desire to say that in British Columbia, we have been led to understand most\ndistinctly from the utterances of public men.\nand from the opinions enunciated in leading\njournals in Ontario, that from that quarter at\nleast we  should have no opposition.   We\nwere aware that there-»were in this country,\nsome, who   having   opposed Confederation\nfrom its inception, were still hostile to that\ngreat and good measure, or at best doubtful\nfriends   to   its   accomplishment, convinced\nagainst their will but of the same opinion\nstill, and  from those gentlemen we anticipated antagonism to our Union with the Dominion.    But the people of Ontario we have\nregarded as our natural allies in this connection, and we supposed that the leaders of\npolitical parties in that province would unite\nin extending confederation westward on any\nreasonable terms which might be laid before\nthem.     During the  course of this debate I\nhave heard many statements made and opinions expressed depreciatory,  and as it appeared to me extravagantly depreciatory, of\nour country and our people.    (Hear, hear.)\nI believe that those statements were made\nhonestly though upon false information. But\nnot the less do I regret that those statements\nare about to inflict much mortification and\nbitterness of heart upon the people  of our\ncountry.     They cannot know the   circumstances under which these statements were\nuttered, and will not therefore make allowances for those who uttered them as I do.    I\nhave never believed that it was a part of my\nmission here to vaunt the material wealth of\nour country, to extol its excellence, or in any\nway to press British Columbia upon Canada.\nBut I think it is necessary,  after what has\nbeen said, to give you gentlemen here present some just idea of the wealth and worth\nof   our   country.     This   is    no    occasion\nfor   attempting   any   detailed    description\nor statistical essiy on British Columbia, but\nI will endeavor to sketch with as few touches\nas possible,\nTHE LEADING FEATURES OP THE COUNTRY.\nThe position of British Columbia you are\nall well acquainted with, commanding, asl\nit does, not only the trade of the Western\ncontinent of America, and the islands of the\nPacific, but also that of the Trans-Pacific\ncountries. It has a sea coast extending 500\nmiles in a straight line, with a labyrinth of\nislands along its whole length, forming innu-\nimerable harbours, inlets and canals, together\nI with the rivers which empty into them teeming with fish—salmon,sturgeon, mackerel, cod,\nherring, hallibut, oolachans, and last but not\nleast, with whales. These fisheries are a\nsource of wealth at present totally undeveloped with us. We know only of its boundless richness, but except a small beginning in\nwhale fishery, nothing has as yet been done\nto render merchantable these immense resources. Then our forests, extending all\nalong the coast and river courses, of vast extents of timber excellent in quality, and, from\nI their proximity to water carriage, most\nvaluable for shipbuilding and lumbering purposes. This industry in British Columbia\nhas latterly effected a good start, as appears\nfrom the official returns for 1869, that in that\nyear lumber amounting in value to $250,000\nwas exported. Our coal fields too are of\nvast extent—of bituminous coal in Vancouver's Island, along the coast of the mainland\nand 200 miles in the interior of the country.\n| These have been worked to some extent for\nsome years past, and iu 1869, $125,000 worth\nof coal was exported to San Francisco. We\nhave also that which some think more valuable than bituminous coal. In Queen\nCharlotte's Island large deposits of anthracite\ncoal have been discovered, and of this a sample was this year introduced into San Francisco and is now selling at $17.00 a ton as I\nlearn from San Francisco papers. California\nhas very little coal within her own limits,\nand what there exists is of the poorest quality. She is therefore almost altogether supplied by British Columbia, and strange to\nsay, to some extent from Australia. Then\nin 1869 our exports of furs and hides\namounted to $264,000. We possess, also,\nminerals of almost every description. In\nfact, I hardly know of any that have not been\nfound in our country. The gold exported in\n1,867 amounted to a million and a half of dollars ; and we have besides, silver, iron, copper,\nlead, and many other minerals of less importance. Building materials, too, abound; as\nlime, marble, freestone, slate, cement, &c.\nAnd now with regard to lands, I would like\nto speak very carefully, as there appears such\nconflict of opinion here on this point. It is\ntrue, as has been stated, that the country is\nmuch broken up by intersecting mountain\nranges. But it must be remembered that all\nis not mountainous. We have a very large\nquantity of valuable land,available for agricultural and pastoral purposes in British Columbia on the high plateaus and interspersed\namongst the valleys, capable of supporting a\nvery large population, and though not perhaps\nconstituting what may be called,strictly speaking, an agricultural country, yet amounting,\nI think, to from a fourth to a third of the country, a good portion of which is now under\ncultivation, and yields heavy crops of grain\nand roots. As to the climate I am almost\nafraid to touch upon it. It possesses such a\ncharm for one who has experienced it; varying as it does from the humid West of England climate of Vancouver's Island and the done with our own money, not a penny have i\nwe ever had from England. The road which I\nwe have built from the head of the navigation\non the Lower Fraser, to Cariboo cost us a\nmillion and a half dollars. It is wrong to\nsay that any portion of the population is nomadic. Such is not the case. There are\nsome two thousand miners who work steadily\nin the mining district the year round—they\ncannot be called nomadic, and the rest of the\npopulation are farmers for the most part or\ntraders, or professional men, and small as the\ncommunity is, it is, I believe as intelligent,\nhardworking and loyal to the British Flag as\nany in Canada.   (Cheers.)\nTHE UNION QUESTION IN THE COLONY.\nPermit me now to trace the history of Confederation in British Columbia,\nand to review the position of the question^\nthere at the present time. In March 1867,\nwhile your delegates were in London, completing the negotiations which resulted in the present British North America Act, our Legislative Council, then composed of fourteen\nofficial and nine selected members, but all appointed by the Governor, being in session, passed an unanimous resolution praying that they might be allowed\nthe opportunity of entering the Confederation at some future day on terms fair and\nequitable. And that sentiment exists to-day\nand to an increased degree. (Hear, hear, and\ncheers.) This resolution was telegraphed by\nsome parts of the country, but even along the I our Governor to the Secretary of State. I\nmain road the cost of carrying freight from know not whether this resolution was in-\nthe sea coast to Cariboo is fifteen cents a strumental in causing the 146th section to\npound. Six dollars a day is considered poor be inserted in the British North America Act,\nman's digging there, and wages are mainly but shortly after our message was sentare-\nfrom this cause proportionately high. There ply was received informing us that provision\nis another reason which I think has operated had been made for our admittance into the\nalmost as largely against our obtaining any Confederation. In 1868, resolutions were\nincrease of population. Up to this year inopportunely introduced into our legisla-\nBritish Columbia has been a Crown colony, ture praying for immediate confederation\nwith a government, so to speak, despotic, with Canada; but in view of the fact that the\nthere being no popular representative body, great North-West was still unconnected with\nSuch a form of government is supremely dis- the Dominion, this movement was voted pre-\ntasteful to any Anglo Saxon community, and mature and impracticable.

I have pointed\nout to you sufficient material resources and\nadvantages to show that apart from its political value to Canada, this is a country worth\nhaving. (Hear, hear, and cheers.) And I\nknow no reason why this country, now separ\nrated and isolated, should not become\na source of great wealth to this Dominion.   (Hear, hear.)\nWHY BRITISH COLUMBIA HAS NOT PROSPERED.\nBut it has been asked why is it that\nyou have so small a population in this\ncountry ? Vou have not far to seek for\nthe answer. To my mind the reasons\nare very plain and very simple. British\nColumbia is a most isolated country, cut off\nfrom Great Britain by a sea voyage of 150\ndays, and walled in to the east by the Rocky\nMountains, preventing all communication\nwith this country, and still more shut off on\nthe south by the United States, through\nwhich all immigrants to British Columbia\nhave to .pass. We know what is done in San\nFrancisco to prevent those immigrants from\ncoming to us,—how our eountry, government, and institutions are misrepresented.\nAnother difficulty is its inaccessibility.\nGood roads have, to be sure, been made to\nman for  man with\nAnd I adduce to you as a proof of. what I\nhave said what has already been done in that\ncolony still in its cradle.

These\neastern portion of this continent to compare assurances have been strictly fulfilled. The\nwith our coach roads; and  all this we have | terms of Union   agreed upon between the\nI delegates from British Columbia and the Dominion Government last year, were submitted\non the 18th! of last January, to a Legislative\nCouncil, composed of nine representatives\nand six appointed members, and unanimously\nadopted. (Cheers) I should now like to\nspeak about\nTHE  TERMS  OF UNION  THEMSELVES\nand show you how they appear\nfrom a British Columbian point of\nview, and I will confine myself to the questions of the financial arrangements, the representation and the railway undertaking—the\nonly points which were really opposed during the discussion in Parliament. I will first\nspeak off the financial arrangement, and with\nyour permission, I will take you back to the\ntime when the scheme was first discussed in\nthe Executive Council of British Columbia.\nAs soon as we came to consider the question\nof terms we arrived at the conclusion that\nno scheme based on the actual population of\nthe country was capable of being adopted ;\nthat it was simply impossible that we should\nreceive a sufficient subsidy on those conditions to carry on the affairs of the Province,\nand that it was impossible to proceed according to the strict terms of the British North\nAmerican Act in this respect. Having arrived at this conclusion, that by some means\nwe must have a certain sum of money, we\nresolved to adopt a fictitious scheme, based\nupon the customs revenue of the country.\nThis scheme was rejected by your government\nin conference with our delegation last June,\nand I think properly so, but we then insisted\nthat we must have a certain sum of money,\nand urged that it was unwise to cut the\nmeans of the Colony down below the revenue actually required for necessary\nexpenditures, as the Dominion would only\nultimately find itself obliged to make a more\nliberal arrangement;- and we pointed out that\nthe Colony was giving up the only elastic\nsource of revenue which we have—the Custom's revenue—the only source of revenue\ncapable of meeting the growing requirements\nof the people, and that even if we got at\nfirst more subsidy than our population en\ntitled us to, year by year as our numbers increased the Dominion would get the better\nbargain financially. It was then proposed\nthat for the land to be made over by the\nColony for the construction of the railway,\nwe should get a certain sum of $100,000 annually, and to this arrangement we assented.\nA false impression has been created on this\npoint. We came here last year willing\nenough to give any reasonable amount of\nland in aid of the- railway, and asked no\ncompensation for it. But it should be borne\nin mind that the extent of land to be contributed by British Columbia for this object,\nis manifold greater in proportion to her\npopulation than that to be supplied by Ontario or by the Dominion, whose people are\nequally interested with us in this railroad enterprise, and it cannot therefore be justly\nheld that we drove a hard bargain in this\nmatter. (Hear, hear.) I assure you that the\nquestion of representation has not been considered of so much importance in British\nColumbia as it has here. I have always\nI thought and stated as my opinion, that the\n| strength of British Columbia in the Confederation must consist in her weakness,\nthat in oraer to make the Dominion prosper,\nyou must make British Columbia prosper,\nand that therefore the whole country would\ncherish our interests, and that the main use\nof our representatives must be at first\nto give information as to a country of-\nwhich so little is known—as has been so\nclearly shown by the late debates. When\nour delegation came here last year our\nscheme proposed a representation in the Commons of eight members, proportioned to a\npopulation based on the customs revenue of\nthe country. This was reduced to six, and we\nnot unwillingly agreed to the reduction. But\nwe have never been able to appreciate that we\nwere bound by the British North America\nAct in this matter of representation, and had\nwe been told that we could have under that\nAct no representation, as I have heard argued,\nor only one member, we would have certainly\nsaid, \"Much obliged to you, we will remain a\nlittle longer as we are.\" (Hear, hear.) And\nnow with regard to\nTHE  RAILWAY  CIiAUSE\nof these terms. After all the rest of the\nscheme of union had been framed in Executive Council, it was unanimously agreed, and\nthis conclusion has been supported by the\nsentiment of the whole community, that\nthere could not be any real union with Canada without a material connection by the\nconstruction of a coach road first, to be followed at once by a railway. That was the\nconclusion arrived at by our Legislative\nCouncil in, 1870, and urged upon your Government by the British Columbia delegates\nas a sine qua non of our union. There was a\nvery great lack of confidence in Canada at\nthat time on the part of some members of the\nLegislative Council, and among the people of\nVictoria, not because those gentlemen, who\nwere nearly all Englishmen, had any leaning\ntowards the United States, but because they\nfeared that Canada was not in a position to\nundertake the construction of this material\nconnection by railway between British Columbia and this part of the Dominion. If\nCanada were not to make this connection,\nthen we might just as well seek union with\nAustralia or New Zealand (hear, hear.) If\nwe were only to become a mere isolated colony of Canada we had better remain as we\nwere, a separate colony of England. We argued \" If Canada is now ready to make\nthis railway, then let us join her at once,\nif not we shall do better to stay as we are\nuntil she is prepared to undertake the responsibility of that enterprise.\" We never\nthought of requiring the construction of this\nrailway as the price of our union with the\nDominion, but we\\had been told that Canada\nwas ready to build this railway, that it was a\n\t 8\npolitical and commercial necessity for her to\ndo so, and that she wanted British Columbia\nchiefly for the purpose of making this railway through our country to the Pacific.\nUnder these circumstances we were ready,\nwe were desirous of entering into this Confederation. In the early part of these remarks\nI told you that, we in British Columbia had\nbeen led to expect, from the utterances of her\npublic men and from the views expressed by\nher journalists, that the union of British\nColumbia with the Dominion would have\nmet with the hearty approval of Ontaria, that\nthe construction at once of the Canadian\nPacific Railway would meet with her ready\nsupport, and I intimated to you, Sir, that I\nknew that British Columbia would be, as I\nwas, astonished at the position taken by many\nmembers of Parliament from Ontario. And\nin support of that position I pray you to allow me to read to you an extract from the\nBritish Colonist of the 15th March, published\nin Victoria, which I received three days\nsince. In a leading article our Victoria editor\nwrites as follow:\n\" British Columbia owes much, to the Toronto\nGlobe for the force find ability with which It has\nall along pre*ssed upon the Dominion of Canada\nthe necessity mi adopting a broad, vigorous, and\ntruly national policy with respect to throwing\nopen the great North West and pressing onward\nto the Pacific. Our big contemporary is doubtless not altogether free from faults and failings,\nbut this one virtue ought t'» cover a multitude of\nsins, to the eye of British Columbia at least. In\narecent number of the Globe weflnda very able\nleading article upon the subject of the Canadian\nPacific Railway. Our contemporary alludes to\nthe argument so commonly put forward by our\nAmerican neighbours, viz., that the American\nNorthern Pacific Railway, running, as it do's\nnear the boundary line, and draining, as it wi'l,\nth? British ossessions lying to the north of the\nforiy-ninth parallel, must forever forbid the idea\nof a Canadian Pacific line proving a success, if,\nindeed it does not forbid the idea of such a line\never iwinsr built. To this our contemporary the\nGi> be well replied:—\nI may remark that the following extract is\nquoted by our editor verbatim from the To-\nr. nto Globe of the 3rd Februaiy, as I have\nascertained by reference to a file of that\njournal :\n\"T .'• main line of th» North Pacific at no\npoint of its rout,\" approaches within a hundred\nand fifty miles of British territory, while in general it is at a much greater distance from the\nboundary Imp. supposing our great lak^s blotted\nout, and a wilderness of a hundred and fifty\nmi es stretching along the whole border line of\nOntaria, would any one argue that a railway far\ndown in Pennsylvania and New York would be\nquite sufficient io developp the resources of this\ncountry, and that all Canadian lines would be\nreally so much money thrown away ? Yet such\nan argument would not be so foolish and inconclusive as what is urged against the construction\nof a great Canadian Trans-Continental Railway.\n\"The proposed route of that undertaking is, on\nan average, four hundred miles north of that\nbeing made from Duiuth, and instead of being,\nas a large part of both the American lines must\nbe. through an irreclaimable desert, it runs\nthrough a country which, in fertility and climate, will com pare favorably with any part of\nthe North American Continent.\n\"When this, has been stated, nothing else is necessary. Any person of ordinary intelligence\ncan see at. a glance that a railway which never,\nthroughout its whole course comes within a\nhundred miles of the borderline of a country,\ncan do very little to delevope the resources of\nI that country. It is better than nothing, but this\nis a'l that c^n be said in its behalf. Tne immediate territory through which it runs would be\nbenefitted chiefly, and in the first place and\nall beyond only incidentally, and after the lapse\nof many years.\n\"inst-ad of the fact that the North Pacific is\nunder construe ion being an argument for Blowing the Canadian project to lie in the meanwhile in abeyance, it affords the strongest reason possible for its being pushed throi gh without delay. Politically it is a manifest and pressing necessity, whilp commercially It is as evidently of the very highest importance for Canada. I n i his way alone can this country have\nany chance for her fair share in hjprative trade\nwith the North-west which will assuredly spring\nup, and in the varied traffic with the Pacfic\nworld which to a great extent will pa«s through\nI Canadian territory, if one; what will be the\nshortest and easiest route from ocean to ocean is\nin working order.\"\nThe British Columbia editor on this remarks :\n\"Our readers will agree with the foregoing,\nwhile they will most heartily en orse and enthusiastically applaud the following paragraph\nwith which the Globe's article concludes :\n\"Our neighbours know the value of the prize\ninvolved, and are making giganlie efforts to secure it exclusively for themselves, uur rulers\nwill be traitors to their country and to Bri ish\nconnection if they lose a single season in making\nit practicable and convenient for settlers to go\nto hort Garry through our own territory) and in\nputting things in a fair way for the Canadian\nPacific Railway. It is a question not merely of\nconvenience but of national existence. It must\nbe pushed through at whatever expense. W'e\nbelieve it can be so pushed through, ' not only\nwithout being a burden pecuniarily upon Canada, but with an absolute profit in every point of\nview. Without such a line a great British North\nAmerica would turn out an unsubstantial\ndream; with it, and with ordinary prudence\nrnd wisdom on the part of her statesmen, it\nwill be a great, a glorious, and inevitable reality.\"\nI cannot imagine any stronger argument\nin favour of the immediate construction of\nthe proposed railway, by even its most enthusiastically interested British Columbian\nadvocates, than that here urged by the editor\nof the Toronto Globe. This work which he\nso pressingly insists on as a political necessity, and as of the highest commercial importance, we proposed to you to undertake ;\nand this work you have engaged to commence\nat once, and to complete at the earliest practicable period, that is to say, as we have estimated, in ten year* from the date of union.\nTHE  TEN TEARS'  LIMITATION.\nAnd now, Sir, I speak with special care, as I\ndesire that full weight should be given to\nevery word I utter on this point, that is to\nsay, as- to the understanding which I had\nwhen this clause was framed, and still have;\nof the intention of this engagement by the\nDominion to construct the Canadian Pacific\nRailway within ten years. When we came\nto you in June last,,we proposed that you\nshould build'at once a coach road from Fort\nGarry to the Pacific, and within three years\nbegin! a railway, and we sought to bind you\nto spend a million of dollars annually on the\nsection of this railroad in British Columbia,\nand to complete its construction with the\nutmost possible despatch. We fully understood then that once the road was commenced, it must be urged to its completion\nraSfc as a matter of course, as a business necessity,\nand that instead of $1,000,000 being spent,\nprobably $5,000,000 would be yearly expended in British Columbia. We knew, in fact,\nthat if the road were to be completed at all,\nit would have to be proceeded with at a far\nfaster rate than a million a year would insure.\nBut there were those in British Columbia\nwho thought that Canada would not undertake the work at all, and it was to satisfy\ntheir doubts, to secure their adhesion to the\nscheme, that the guarantee of the expenditure of the $1,000,000 annually was asked.\nThe Government, on conference with our*\ndelegation, at once expressed their readiness\nto commence at once the railroad to the Pacific, and to complete it as soon as it was practicable to do so; but the coach road was objected to as an unnecessary expense, in view of the\nimmediate construction of a railroad. We\nfrom British Columbia were prepared to accept this amendment of the scheme, and wc\naccordingly proceeded to calculate the time\nit would probably take to build the railroad,\nand we agreed upon an estimated period of\nten years. If it had been put at twelve or\nfifteen years, British Columbia would\nhave been just as well satisfied,\nand if the estimated period had been reduced\nto eight years she would scarcely have been\nbetter pleased; but some definite period for\nthe completion of this work the British Columbia delegates insisted on as a necessary\nsafeguard to our colony in entering into the\nproposed union. To argue that any other\ninterpretation will be placed upon this railway engagement by British Columbia than\nthat which I have given to you as my construction of it,—to argue that she expects it\nto be carried out in the exact interpretation\nof the words themselves, regardless of all\nconsequences, is a fallacy which cannot bear\nthe test of common sense. (Hear, hear ) The\ncase stands thus : British Columbia is about\nto enter into a partnership with Canada, and\none of the terms of the articles of partnership is that we are under the partnership to\nconstruct a railway upon certain conditions.\nIs British Columbia going to hold her partner\nto that which will bring ruin and bankruptcy upon the firm? Surely you would\nthink us fools indeed if we adopted such a\ncourse. I would protest, and the whole of\nBritish Columbia would protest, if the government proposed to borrow $100,000,000 or\nS150,000,000 to construct this road; (hear,\nhear,) running the country into debt, and\ntaxing the people of British Columbia as well\nas of the rest of the Dominion to pay the\nburden of such a debt. Why, sir, I heard it\nsaid the other evening that British Columbia\nhad made a most Jewish bargain with you in\nthese terms, but even Shylock himself would\nnot exact his pound of flesh if a portion of it\nhad to be cut from his own body. (Lcud\ncheers and laughter.) I am sure that you\nwill find that British Columbia is a pretty\nintelligent community, which will be apt to\nfake a business view of this matter. She\nwill expect that this railway shall be com-\n1 menced in two years, for that is clearly\npracticable; and she will also expect that\nI the financial ability of the Dominion will be\nj exerted to its utmost, within the limits of\nreason, to complete it in the time named in\nthe agreement; but you may rest assured\nthat she will not regard this railway engagement as a \" cast-iron contract,\" as it has been\ncalled, or desire that it should be carried out\nin any other way than as will secure the\nprosperity of the'whole Dominion of which\nshe is to be a part. (Cheers.) I have understood this railway engagement in this way\nfrom the first, and I still so understand it.\nI believed when we negotiated this clause in\nthe terms of union last year, and I now believe, that it is not only practicable for this\nroad to be built by a liberal land grant and\na moderate money subsidy, but that it will\nbe so built and completed within the estimated period of ten years But if a mistake\nhas been made in this estimate, do not thiuk\nthat British Columbia is going to put a\nstrained interpretation upon the agreement,\nto her own material injury; that she is likely,\nas the saying is, to bite her own nose off to\nspite her face.\nESTIMATED  COST  OP THE RAILWAY.\nI will enter into no estimate to-night\nof the cost of the section of the proposed road east of the Rocky Mountains.\nYou have as good means of forming opinions\non the probable expenditure that will be required on this portion of the line as I have.\nBut I will speak of the probable cost of the\nline in British Columbia through a country\nwith which I am personally acquainted.\nBritish Columbia, Sii, is not such an unknown, unexplored country as it has been\nsupposed or represented to be. I may mention to you that in 1865 and 1866, in obedience to a despatch from the Secretary of\nState, asking for information regarding\nthe facilities for the construction of a\nwaggon road across the mountains, to connect with the Red River settlement, I instituted, under the Governor's direction, explo- !\nrations of the country between Fraser River\nand the Rocky Mountain range, and the report of these explorations, together wit^i.a\nminute from myself thereon, summing\nup all the information then obtainable,\nwere printed and have been made public.\nIt is, I think, pretty certain that the choice\nfor the line through the Rocky Mountains is\nbetween Leather Pass and Howse's Pass; but\nfrom the Western outlet of either of those\npasses, there are several lines of route to the\nPacific, and I do not prttend now to offer\nany opinion as to the relative merits of these\nseveral lines. I will speak only of that\none which I am most acquainted with, having passed over nearly this whole line from\nthe Pacific to the Rocky Mountains, on horseback or on foot, and over parts of it frequently. I mean a line from the mouth of the\nFraser, following up the course of that river\nand of one of its tributaries, the Thompson,\nto the head waters of the south branch of 10\nthe latter river, in Shuswap Lake, thence\nthrough the Eagle Pass across a summit of\nthe Gold Range, four hundred and seventy\nfeet above the Lake level to the Columbia\nRiver, and up the Columbia and one of its\nsmall tributaries, called Blackberry River, to\nHowse's Pass. This is not only a practicable\nline but it will give a gradual ascent to the\nsummit of the Rocky Mountains, from which\npoint the descent to the Red River will be\nalmost a regular incline, in very favorable\ncomparison with the grade of the road now\nin operatien between San Francisco and\nOmaha, which passes over four successive\nI summits, the lowest of which is two thou-\nr sand feet higher than that we have to over-\n1 come on the Rocky Mountains. Now, Sir,\nin the absence of detailed surveys and sections, no one can make a close estimate of\nthe cost of this line; but I venture to express my opinion in which I am supported by\nother gentlemen, like myself engineers, who\nhave gone over the line, that notwithstanding some portions of the work on this road\nalong the Canon of the Fraser would be\nvery expensive, the whole distance from the\nPacific seaboard to the summit of the Rocky\nMountains, a distance of about six hundred\nmiles, may be set down at an approximate estimate of  $60,000   per  mile.\nRESULT OP DEFEAT OP UNION.\nI have been frequently asked of late—and I\nmention this point as it has been discussed\nso warmly in Parliament. \" What would\nhave been the result in British Columbia had\nthe address in favor of her union with Canada\nbeen voted down ?\" Well, Sir, as I have\nsaid already this evening, the people of British- Columbia are not only an intelligent but\na loyal community—throughout the whole\ncountry there exists strong attachment to\n-British connection. They have never as a\npeople had any inclination for the United\nStates or any proclivity toward the institutions of that country; and though there-was\nat one time in the year before last an attempt\non the part of a few disaffected persons to\nraise such an issue, it was so speedily hooted\ndown thatthe very word annexation has\nbeen ever since taboed among us. But,\nhad this address not been carried there would\nhave been the deepest disappointment\nthroughout our colony and profound discouragement to the best friends there of Confederation. Our people have been given to\nunderstand from all quarters in Canada as I\nbefore told you that the Canadian Pacific\nRailway was to be built at once—they have\nregarded their union with Canada on the\nterms arranged by your'Goyernment as afore-\ngone conclusion—and had they been told by\nyou as they would in fact have been told by\nycur refusal to confirm those terms, \" we\nare not able to undertake the building of\nthis Railway, we are not prepared to take the\nresponsbility of uniting British Columbia\nto us, not equal to the occasion which presents itself,\" they would certainly with embittered   feelings have at once and unani\nmously refused to unite with you on any\nother terms, and what might have been the\nultimate rosult I would prefer not to conjecture. But, Sir, happily we have escaped any\nsuch risk as this would have occasioned to\nthe consolidation of British interests on this\ncontinent, and are met here to-night to rejoice over the consummation of the great\nwork of the union of British Columbia to the Dominion. (Cheers.)\nI must apologise for the length of these\nremarks on a social occasion such as this is,\nbut there were some points with regard to\nthe true bearing and intention of the terms\nof union of our colony with Canada which I\nhave considered it very desirable, not only\nfor the sake of our community, but\" in the\ninterest of this whole Dominion, to comment\non, and explain from a British Columbia\npoint of view, and I have availed myself of\nthis opportunity of doing so as I see no probability of any other being afforded me just\nnow. And now, sir, I beg to renew my acknowledgements of-the high compliment paid this\nevening to British Columbia in the person\nof her representative. For myself I can only\nassure you that I shall ever cherish a grateful recollection of the very great kindness\nwhich I have received from the many friends\nwith whom I have had the pleasure of becoming acquainted in Canada, and especially,\nMr. Chairman, from yourself. On behalf of\nthe people of British Columbia—the youngest of the fair sisterhood of federated provinces now spread across this broad continent\nfrom ocean to ocean—I express the heartfelt\ndesire—long may this goodly Dominion\nflourish and grow in honor among the nations under the dear old flag that now waves\nover us—enjoying year by year an increasing\nmeasure of material prosperity, and truest\nhappiness 1 and in direct connection with this\nsentiment I propose to you in the name of\nour colony a toast which I know needs no\nfurther preface here to-night—to those to\nwhom British Columbia and this whole Dominion owe so much—\" Her Majesty's Ministers.\"   (Loud and prolonged cheers.)\nThe toast having been enthusiastically\ndrank,\nSir G. E. Cartier, on behalf of his colleagues and himself, returned their most sincere thanks. With regard to this present\nministry it should be borne in mind that it\nwas the offspring of Confederation. From\nthe 1st of July, 1867, it had been the task of\nthe ministry ever to extend the incomplete\nscheme of Oonfederation. It was their happy lot to-day to see this in a measure completed.   (Hear, hear, and cheers.)\nHon. Mr. Campbell said that he was happy\nto submit to Sir George's response for the\nministry. He was sure they were all delighted that Sir George had been so happy in leading during the absence of Sir John. (Hear.)\nThe mottoe of the present ministry had ever\nbeen \" One Queen, one flag, one destiny.\"\n(Loud cheers.) That had been the feeling\nwhich had influenced them, and when they 11\npassed away, the result of that influence would\nremain forever. (Cheers.)\nHon. Dr. Tupper, alluded to the rapid\nstrides which had been made in this country.\nWho, he said, in 1867 would have dreamt\ntbat they would have been enabled to night\nto celebrate the admission of British Columbia into the union. (Cheers.) He would\nnot add a single word to what had been al\nready said by the leader of the Government.\nHe begged permission to offer a volunteer\ntoast that of \" our sister Province Manitoba,\"\n•the representatives of which they had for\nthe first time sitting with them at the\nfestive board.\nThe   toast having   been  enthusiastically\nhonoured,\nDr. Sohultz, who was warmly received on\nrising, said that as \" Manitoba\" was not on\nthe list of proposed toasts he had not expected to have had the honor to reply on behalf\nof the Province, a portion of which he had\nthe honor to represent. Still, since they had\nchosen to do honor to the Prarie Province,\nhe would say something on her behalf. He\nhad listened with a very great deal of plea-\nenre to the remarks of their honored guest,\nMr. Truteh, and he felt that hon. gentleman\nhad made out a very strong and very satisfactory case in favor of our newly acquired\nProvince of British Columbia. (Hear, hear.)\nHe felt especially pleased to meet Mr. Truteh\nen this festive occasion, because he felt tbat\nit would probably be the last time he could\nmeet him in friendship. (Laughter.) It\nwas quite evident to him that the two West-\nem Provinces were to be rivals, and that\nwhen he met Mr. Truteh on the floor of the\nHouse of Commons next year each one would\ninsist on the special advantages ,which his\nProvince offered, and that there would be an\nantagonism which he trusted would not result disastrously. (Laughter.) While they\nwere yet friends, therefore, he must congratulate the hon. gentleman who had setfbe-\nfore them so clearly the somewhat intricate\nstate of affairs in the Province he represent-\njed. Mr. Truteh had dwelt upon the wealth\nof British Columbia in its fisheries, its coal\nfields, its timber and its gold. Well, Manitoba had something to offer too, or rather\nwould have when its boundaries were extended. It had its fisheries not to be despised;\nit had its gold fields, though people could\nnot as yet pick up nuggets as in British Columbia. (Laughter.) Still there were those\nwho when washing the shining sands of the\nUpper Saskatchewan argued that on our side\nof the Rocky Mountains there existed the\nmatrix from which these golden grains had\ndrifted. What Manitoba however had chiefly\nto offer to the Dominion was agricultural re-|\nsources, homes to the immigrant, a yield of,\ngrain unequalled in any country. What British Columbia seemed to need was wealth—\nwhat Manitoba needed was population. He\nwas willing that Mr. Truteh should get for\nhis Province all the capitalists if he could\n•.secure for Manitoba that immigration which\nher natural resources gave her the right to\nexpect. He felt very hopeful about the future of his Province. Indeed since the acquisition of British Columbia he had begun\nto take very large views ; he was even beginning to think that the capitol was not central enough in the new Dominion. (Laughter.) He would not be surprised if many\nof us lived to see the Capitol removed to\nsome place in the valley of Sackatchewan\nnow occupied only by the roaming tribes of\nthat region. The only want which Manitoba\nhad besides population was communication,\nand it was with great pleasure he learned on\nhis arrival in Canada that the Pacific Railway had been legislated and determined\nupon. (Cheers.) He looked upon the acquisition of these western Provinces in the light\nof an investment, profitable if their resources\nwere developed, useless if not, and a Railroad was the only way to develop them. Without Railroad communication, he considered\nthe £300,000, expended for its purchase, the\ntwo million dollars spent to put down rebellion, and the proposed payment of $67,000 a\nyear for the support of its Government, as\njust so much means squandered, so much\nmoney sunk for no possible good. (Cheers.)\nHad we railroad communication, we couid\nenter the emigrant centres of the old world\nand fairly bid, and even outbid all competitors. Could we at a reasonable cost transport the emigrant into Manitoba, we could\noffer him 160 acres of better prairie land that\ncan be found in the Western States, free. We\ncan Offer him the fnll privileges of citizenship after three years residence, instead of\nthe five years insisted on further South. We\ncan offer him a country where taxes are\nscarcely known, where such necessaries of\nlife, as could not be produced on his own\nfields or manufactured by himself, can be\nbought at one-half the cost of those articles\nin the much lauded Western States Where,\nin addition he may expect an average yield\none-third greater than that of the most productive grain raising State of the Union.\n(Cheers.) Could we be assured of receiving\nsuch an immigration then, it seemed to\nhim that success is certain. It is all\nright for us, to have these Eastern Pro- ■\nvinces depleted for our benefit, but there\nis, in that, no substantial advantage to\nthe Dominion at large. To use the immense resources we must have increased population, and with that, will come wealth\nrapidly enough. We must in building up a\nnation not depend alone on our own population and the emigrant class of the British .\nIsles, we must have our share, a monopoly\neven, if we can get it, of that Scandinavian\nand German element which is building up the\nnation south of us. (Cheers.) In conclusion\nDr. Schultz thanked the assembly for the\ngood feeling they expressed towards Manitoba, he felt convinced that they would not\nfind that Province to be the weakest nor the\npoorest of that chain which now girdled the\ncontinent; and if this great scheme that we\nhave set on foot, this effort to establish on\n\t >*m\nthis continent a great and prosperous British\npower; if it should so unfortunately happen\nthat this scheme should be frustrated, this\nlaudable effort fail, he felt certain that its\nfailure will have to be ascribed to some other\ncause than a lack of natural resources, in\nthat Confederation which now extends from\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific and which embraces a territory greater than that of half\nthe Kingdoms of Europe, or that of our natural rivals, the United States.   (Cheers.)\nMr. Smith, M. P. for Selkirk, Manitoba,\nafter repeated calls, rose and said that, after\nwhat had fallen from the gentleman who had\npreceded him, there was little more to be\nsaid. As it had been determined that they\nwere to have a railway connection with this\ncountry, he would say something about the\nroute. It had been said that the route from\nFort Garry to Canada was almost impracticable. He believed, from what he could\nlearn from people who had traversed that\nroute, that this was not the case. (Hear,\nhear.) By following the old route taken by\nthe Hudson's Bay Company's officials, going\nbehind Nipissing, touching Nepigon, and\nskirting Lasalle, they would be able to pass\nthrough a country, certainly not quite equal\nto some portions of the Dominion, but, both\nas regarded climate and soil, not inferior to\nmuch of the country through which the Intercolonial Railway runs. At the Lake of the\nWoods they reached the prairie, which extended for fourteen hundred miles to the\nwestward, and afforded facilities for the construction of a railway unequalled by that\nthrough which any railway in the Dominion\npassed. (Hear, hear.) Then as to the resources of the country. They possessed large\nfisheries, and though they might not have a\nfish with the colour of a salmon, they had the\nwhite fish, which was far superior in flavour.\nThey, too, had found nuggets of gold, and\nthey were possessed of salt mines, which\nwere sufficient to supply the whole Dominion. There were large beds of coal, too,\non the Assiniboine and the Saskatchewan,\nand a great deal of coal oil somewhat\nnorth; and, besides, there were copper, iron, lead, &c, in abundance,\nand in the Pran River district they have a\ncountry quite equal to that of the Saskatchewan, and a climate which admitted of win\ntering herds of cattle out in the prairies,\nwhere they grazed throughout the whole\nyear, instead of being obliged to staUfeed\nthem for at least four months, as is the case\nboth in Ontario and Quebec (cheers). It had\nbeen supposed that the great difficulty in'\nManitoba was the lack of building material.\nBut the fact was that the shores of Lake\nWinnipeg would supply large quantities of\nexcellent granite and stone, and there were\nalso extensive beds of clay, which could be\nused for the manufacture of bricks, and during the last year a considerable quantity of\nbricks had been made. He thought, therefore, that for building material theyweie\npretty well off. (Hear, hear.) He believed\nthat during the coming years two steamers\nwould be running on Red River, for a distance of 160 miles, which would connect\nthat country with the railway system of the\nUnited States. On the Lake Manitoba (from\nwhich to Fort Garry the distance was only\nsixty miles over a perfectly level country)\nand the Saskatchewan River there would\ndoubtless also be steamers within a couple\nof years, thus to a certain extent opening up\nand giving the means of bringing down the\ncoal and other products of that extensive and\nvaluable district—but the great desideratum-\nwas railway communication; and he believed\nthat within the ten years spoken of the\nrailway would be built, and that the friends\nof those people who were going from Ontario\nand Quebec to Manitoba would not let the\nmatter rest, but would press forward as\nrapidly as possible the railway to the North\nWest.   (Loud cheers.)\nSir George Cartier then proposed the\nhealth of the speakers of the two Houses of\nParliament, regretting that domestic affliction\nprevented the attendance of the speaker of\nthe Senate.\nHon. Mr. Cockburn, Speaker of the House\nof Commons, responded in his usual happy\nfe train.\nThen followed \" the Press \" to which Mr..\nThomas White of the Gazette responded, and\n\"the ladies\" responded to by Mr. Savary. \"The\nchairman \" was proposed by Mr. Grant M.P.,\nand after the toast had been duly honoured,,\nthe band played God Save the Queen, and\nthe company separated.\nt",

            "COMPLIMENTARY  DINNER\nTO THE\nJ40N,yVL^ jRUTCHjOFpRITISHpOLUMBIA\nOttawa,   ioth .April,   1871.\n(From the Montreal Gazette.)\nOne of the most interesting events of the\npresent session of the Dominion Parliament was the complimentary dinner given\nto the Hon. Mr. Truteh, Surveyor General of British Columbia, on the evening of the 10th April instant, at the\nEussell House, Ottawa. . The dinner was\nparticipated in by Ministers and by members of both Houses, who, having aided\nin the work of Union, met together to\ncongratulate each other upon what they\nhad accomplished, and to do honour to\nour new sister Colony in the person of her\nrepresentative. Among those who were present were many who, in various capacities,\nhave been warm supporters of that policy\nwhich has resulted in the practical admission of British Columbia and ^the extension\nof the boundaries of the Dominion to the far\naway shores of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe large dining room was decorated in a\nvery tasteful manner with flags, evergreens,\nand appropriate mottoes; among \"the latter\nwe noticed\n\"Westward the march of Empire takes its\nway.\"\n\"The Star of Empire glitters in the \"West.\"\n\"One Queen, one Flag, one Destiny, one\nEmpire.\"\n\"British Connection.\"\n\"Vis unita Fortior.\"\n\"Quis separabit ?\"\n\"A Pacific Kail way.\"\n\" Ontario ;\" '' Quebec ;\" \" New Brunswick;\"\nI Nova Scotia;\" \" Manitoba ;\" ■\" British Columbia ;\" together with several others.\nGowan's band was in attendance in the\ngallery, and did much to promote the enjoyment of the evening by the performance of\nsome excellent music.\nAt eight o'clock the guests walked into\nthe hall to the number of about 200, and\nseated themselves at the tables.\nThe chair was occupied by Sir G. E. Car-\ntier. On his right was Mr. Truteh, and on\nhis left, Hon. Mr. Cockburn, Speaker of the\nHouse of Commons.    The  vice chairs were\noccupied by Mr. Angus Morrison, M.P., and\nMr. Alonzo Wright, MP.\n.When justice had been done to the very\nexcellent dinner provided, the chairman rose\nand proposed the first toast, which was drunk\nwith the usual loyal honors.\nI The Queen.\"\nBand—\" God save the Queen.\"\nThe next toast was \" the Prince and Princess of Wales and the rest of the Boyal\nFamily.\"\nBand—\" The Bed White and Blue.\"\nSir G. E.~Cabtier then proposed the Army,\nNavy, and Volunteers. He might be considered as too intimately connected with the\nlatter to propose a toast of the kind with\npropriety, but he might, at all events, say\nthat the volunteers of Canada had on more\nthan one occasion during the past few years\nbeen called upon to defend their country and\nthey had done so bravely and nobly, and like\npatriotic men (cheers).\nBand—\" British Grenadiers.\"\nLt-Col. Chamberun, C.M.G., in response to\nan unanimous call responded, saying that he\nthanked the company most heartily for the\nhonor done to the volunteers. In presence.\nof the chief of the Canadian Navy and also of\nan officer of the British regular army (Captain Cameron) he could not say anything on\nbehalf of those branches of the service, but\nspeaking for the volunteers he could,without\nany hesitation, testify to the gratification\nthey experienced at having the services which\nthey had rendered in defence of the Empire\nso heartily recognized, and also at finding\ntheir brother volunteers and fellow subjects,\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific, united with\nthem in the glorious privilege of defending\nthe flag of the Empire.    (Cheers.)\nCaptain Cameron was also called upon\nto respond. He said he regretted that a\ndistinguished volunteer officer like Colonel\nChamberlin had not undertaken to speak on.\nbehalf of the regular army- as well as for the\nvolunteers. He alluded to the Imperial\npolicy of withdrawing the troops from Can a-"

            "da, and to the doubts which that policy seem-1\ned to have given rise to in the minds of Canadians.   These doubts are very painful toi\nImperial officers, who know perfectly well\nthat the old English heart still beats beneath\nthe English breast. (Cheers.)   The Imperial\nGovernment- had  a right to withdraw the\ntroops from Canada, and to pursue a policy |\nof concentration  which   any military man\nwould say was a wise one.   But Britain would\nnot forget her children. (Cheers.)\nCommodore Forth? replied on behalf of the\nNavy. He said he was not a member of the\nBoyal navy, but only of the Provincial\nnavy, which was a comparatively small\naffair. Still it must be remembered that a\nnavy did not consist in ships alone, but in\nthe bone and muscle of its sailors, and in\nthe eighty thousand fishermen whom Canada possessed lay the strength of the Canadian navy.   (Cheers.)\nHon. Mr. Mitchell also replied on behalf of\nthe navy. He said that the events of the\npast years had shown that the navy of Canada was of some account, and as for the Royal\nNavy that great and glorious service which\nhas done so much to uphold the honor of the\nEmpire for years past, its fame was world\nwide.    (Cheers.;\nSir George E. Cartier then rose and said\nhe had now to propose the toast of the even-\nin et, \"Our Guest •' the Honorable Mr. Truteh.\nBefore doing so, however, he hoped to be allowed to make a few observations. Lust\nyear we achieved a great deal in extending\nthe boundaries of the Dominion a» far as the\nRocky Mountains. That was a great and\ndifficult work to accomplish, but it was merely an extension of the territorial limits of the\nDominion. Now they had achieved a greater\nwork, they had carried the limits of Canada\nas far as they could go in a westerly direction,\nand the end attained was worth the struggle.\n(Cheers.) Since Mr. Truteh had been in\nCanada he bad won many friends, but he\n(Sir George Carrier) and his colleagues bad\nbetter opportunities than any one else to\nform a more intimate acquaintance with him,\nand British Columbia, he was quite sure, could\nnot have a better representative. He regretted that the two gentlemen who accompanied him as delegates last summer were not\nwith him. Still, he could not help feeling\nthat they enjoyed a great pleasure in having\nMr. Trntch, one of the leading members of\nthe British Columbia Executive-Council, present with them (cheers). We have had our\nstruggle and are now rejoicing over our success, but we must not forget that Mr. Truteh\nand his colleagues have been battling for\nUnion for years. Our triumph was his\ntriumph also, and it was our duty to congratulate and do honour to him (cheers).\nHe (Sir George Cartier) could not forget that\n300 years ago a bold navigator set sail westward to discover a way to the eastern coast\nof Asia. His name was Jacques Cartier\n(cheers). He was followed by Champlain\nand La Salle, and when the latter left the\nplace where now stands the village of La-\nchine, seven miles from Montreal, he said as\nhe sailed westward that he was \"off for\nChina.\" The Canada of which these early\nsettlers dreamed was not a Lower Canada,\nbut a Canada that should really extend to\nChina (cheers). The Canada which we are\nestablishing to-day is the Canada which they\ndesired to see, one that should extend from\nocean to ocean (cheers).\nBand—\" For he's a jolly good fellow.\"\nMr. Teutch then rose and replied as follows :—\nI thank you most heartily, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, for the great honour\nyou have to-night conferred on British\nColumbia through her representative, and\nmy personal acknowledgments are especially due to you, Sir, for the flattering\nterms in which you have spoken of me. I\nam well aware that I am all undeserving of\nthe high encomiums which your politeness\nhas led you to bestow on me. As an Englishman—a loyal British subject—and as a true\nfriend of Briti.sh Columbia, the home of my\nadoption for the past 12 years, my heart has\nbeen thoroughly in the work of extending\nthe Dominion of Canada to the Pacific. But\nI can assume no other merit than this—if\nindeed there can be any merit in the performance of a simple and most pleasurable duty—\nthat I have laboured earnestly under the direction of our most excellent and able Governor, Mr. Musgrave, to promote that great object now so happily attained. But it is not\nthe less gratifying to me, sir, to be the recipient of the cordial welcome extended here\nto-night to British Columbia in the person of\nher representative on her entrance into this\nCon federation of British North America ; a\nwelcome which, I can assure you, will be\nmost gratefully appreciated in that country,\nand cannot fail to draw closer the bonds of\nunion between our community and the people of Canada. Well knowing as I do that I\nam expressing the sentiments of joyful gratitude which possess the entire British population of our colony at this moment, I tender\ntheir thanks to those gentlemen whose votes\nhave secured for us the consummation of our\nhopes and aspirations ; and I congratulate\nyou, Mr. Chairman, and your honourable colleagues in the Dominion Government, on\nyour far-sighted statemanship in bringing\nthis measure, so entirely in accord with the\nclearly enunciated wishes of the Imperial\nGovernment, to a successful issue, undeterred\nby the strenuous opposition urged against it -\nand I confidently express my belief, that as\nthe true merits of this measure are more\nthoroughly understood, as the baselessness\nand fallacy of the objections to the terms of\nour Union, and particularly to the railway\nengagement, are realized throughout the\ncountry, the policy of your Government will\nbe more and more generally and thankfully\nsustained.

            "5\ncriticism   hostile  to   the   action   of  those\nwho placed themselves in antagonism to this\nmeasure.   I can fully believe that those gentlemen took that position in the conscientious discharge of their duty.   But having\nlistened to the whole of the debate on this\nsubject, having taken part in the arrangement of the terms  discussed,   and having\nspecial local acquaintance with the facts involved, I think I may be permitted, indeed I\nconsider it my duty, to comment on some of\nthe objections and arguments urged against\nthe passage of this measure, with the view of\nremoving   misapprehension.     And   in   the\nfirst place I desire to say that in British Columbia, we have been led to understand most\ndistinctly from the utterances of public men.\nand from the opinions enunciated in leading\njournals in Ontario, that from that quarter at\nleast we  should have no opposition.   We\nwere aware that there-»were in this country,\nsome, who   having   opposed Confederation\nfrom its inception, were still hostile to that\ngreat and good measure, or at best doubtful\nfriends   to   its   accomplishment, convinced\nagainst their will but of the same opinion\nstill, and  from those gentlemen we anticipated antagonism to our Union with the Dominion.    But the people of Ontario we have\nregarded as our natural allies in this connection, and we supposed that the leaders of\npolitical parties in that province would unite\nin extending confederation westward on any\nreasonable terms which might be laid before\nthem.     During the  course of this debate I\nhave heard many statements made and opinions expressed depreciatory,  and as it appeared to me extravagantly depreciatory, of\nour country and our people.    (Hear, hear.)\nI believe that those statements were made\nhonestly though upon false information. But\nnot the less do I regret that those statements\nare about to inflict much mortification and\nbitterness of heart upon the people  of our\ncountry.     They cannot know the   circumstances under which these statements were\nuttered, and will not therefore make allowances for those who uttered them as I do.    I\nhave never believed that it was a part of my\nmission here to vaunt the material wealth of\nour country, to extol its excellence, or in any\nway to press British Columbia upon Canada.\nBut I think it is necessary,  after what has\nbeen said, to give you gentlemen here present some just idea of the wealth and worth\nof   our   country.     This   is    no    occasion\nfor   attempting   any   detailed    description\nor statistical essiy on British Columbia, but\nI will endeavor to sketch with as few touches\nas possible,\nTHE LEADING FEATURES OP THE COUNTRY.\nThe position of British Columbia you are\nall well acquainted with, commanding, asl\nit does, not only the trade of the Western\ncontinent of America, and the islands of the\nPacific, but also that of the Trans-Pacific\ncountries. It has a sea coast extending 500\nmiles in a straight line, with a labyrinth of\nislands along its whole length, forming innu-\nimerable harbours, inlets and canals, together\nI with the rivers which empty into them teeming with fish—salmon,sturgeon, mackerel, cod,\nherring, hallibut, oolachans, and last but not\nleast, with whales. These fisheries are a\nsource of wealth at present totally undeveloped with us. We know only of its boundless richness, but except a small beginning in\nwhale fishery, nothing has as yet been done\nto render merchantable these immense resources. Then our forests, extending all\nalong the coast and river courses, of vast extents of timber excellent in quality, and, from\nI their proximity to water carriage, most\nvaluable for shipbuilding and lumbering purposes. This industry in British Columbia\nhas latterly effected a good start, as appears\nfrom the official returns for 1869, that in that\nyear lumber amounting in value to $250,000\nwas exported. Our coal fields too are of\nvast extent—of bituminous coal in Vancouver's Island, along the coast of the mainland\nand 200 miles in the interior of the country.\n| These have been worked to some extent for\nsome years past, and iu 1869, $125,000 worth\nof coal was exported to San Francisco. We\nhave also that which some think more valuable than bituminous coal. In Queen\nCharlotte's Island large deposits of anthracite\ncoal have been discovered, and of this a sample was this year introduced into San Francisco and is now selling at $17.00 a ton as I\nlearn from San Francisco papers. California\nhas very little coal within her own limits,\nand what there exists is of the poorest quality. She is therefore almost altogether supplied by British Columbia, and strange to\nsay, to some extent from Australia. Then\nin 1869 our exports of furs and hides\namounted to $264,000. We possess, also,\nminerals of almost every description. In\nfact, I hardly know of any that have not been\nfound in our country. The gold exported in\n1,867 amounted to a million and a half of dollars ; and we have besides, silver, iron, copper,\nlead, and many other minerals of less importance. Building materials, too, abound; as\nlime, marble, freestone, slate, cement, &c.\nAnd now with regard to lands, I would like\nto speak very carefully, as there appears such\nconflict of opinion here on this point. It is\ntrue, as has been stated, that the country is\nmuch broken up by intersecting mountain\nranges. But it must be remembered that all\nis not mountainous. We have a very large\nquantity of valuable land,available for agricultural and pastoral purposes in British Columbia on the high plateaus and interspersed\namongst the valleys, capable of supporting a\nvery large population, and though not perhaps\nconstituting what may be called,strictly speaking, an agricultural country, yet amounting,\nI think, to from a fourth to a third of the country, a good portion of which is now under\ncultivation, and yields heavy crops of grain\nand roots. As to the climate I am almost\nafraid to touch upon it. It possesses such a\ncharm for one who has experienced it; varying as it does from the humid West of England climate of Vancouver's Island and the"

The road which I\nwe have built from the head of the navigation\non the Lower Fraser, to Cariboo cost us a\nmillion and a half dollars. It is wrong to\nsay that any portion of the population is nomadic. Such is not the case. There are\nsome two thousand miners who work steadily\nin the mining district the year round—they\ncannot be called nomadic, and the rest of the\npopulation are farmers for the most part or\ntraders, or professional men, and small as the\ncommunity is, it is, I believe as intelligent,\nhardworking and loyal to the British Flag as\nany in Canada.   (Cheers.)\nTHE UNION QUESTION IN THE COLONY.\nPermit me now to trace the history of Confederation in British Columbia,\nand to review the position of the question^\nthere at the present time. In March 1867,\nwhile your delegates were in London, completing the negotiations which resulted in the present British North America Act, our Legislative Council, then composed of fourteen\nofficial and nine selected members, but all appointed by the Governor, being in session, passed an unanimous resolution praying that they might be allowed\nthe opportunity of entering the Confederation at some future day on terms fair and\nequitable. And that sentiment exists to-day\nand to an increased degree. (Hear, hear, and\ncheers.) This resolution was telegraphed by\nsome parts of the country, but even along the I our Governor to the Secretary of State.

There ply was received informing us that provision\nis another reason which I think has operated had been made for our admittance into the\nalmost as largely against our obtaining any Confederation. In 1868, resolutions were\nincrease of population.

            "delegates from British Columbia and the Dominion Government last year, were submitted\non the 18th! of last January, to a Legislative\nCouncil, composed of nine representatives\nand six appointed members, and unanimously\nadopted. (Cheers) I should now like to\nspeak about\nTHE  TERMS  OF UNION  THEMSELVES\nand show you how they appear\nfrom a British Columbian point of\nview, and I will confine myself to the questions of the financial arrangements, the representation and the railway undertaking—the\nonly points which were really opposed during the discussion in Parliament. I will first\nspeak off the financial arrangement, and with\nyour permission, I will take you back to the\ntime when the scheme was first discussed in\nthe Executive Council of British Columbia.\nAs soon as we came to consider the question\nof terms we arrived at the conclusion that\nno scheme based on the actual population of\nthe country was capable of being adopted ;\nthat it was simply impossible that we should\nreceive a sufficient subsidy on those conditions to carry on the affairs of the Province,\nand that it was impossible to proceed according to the strict terms of the British North\nAmerican Act in this respect. Having arrived at this conclusion, that by some means\nwe must have a certain sum of money, we\nresolved to adopt a fictitious scheme, based\nupon the customs revenue of the country.\nThis scheme was rejected by your government\nin conference with our delegation last June,\nand I think properly so, but we then insisted\nthat we must have a certain sum of money,\nand urged that it was unwise to cut the\nmeans of the Colony down below the revenue actually required for necessary\nexpenditures, as the Dominion would only\nultimately find itself obliged to make a more\nliberal arrangement;- and we pointed out that\nthe Colony was giving up the only elastic\nsource of revenue which we have—the Custom's revenue—the only source of revenue\ncapable of meeting the growing requirements\nof the people, and that even if we got at\nfirst more subsidy than our population en\ntitled us to, year by year as our numbers increased the Dominion would get the better\nbargain financially. It was then proposed\nthat for the land to be made over by the\nColony for the construction of the railway,\nwe should get a certain sum of $100,000 annually, and to this arrangement we assented.\nA false impression has been created on this\npoint. We came here last year willing\nenough to give any reasonable amount of\nland in aid of the- railway, and asked no\ncompensation for it. But it should be borne\nin mind that the extent of land to be contributed by British Columbia for this object,\nis manifold greater in proportion to her\npopulation than that to be supplied by Ontario or by the Dominion, whose people are\nequally interested with us in this railroad enterprise, and it cannot therefore be justly\nheld that we drove a hard bargain in this\nmatter. (Hear, hear.) I assure you that the\nquestion of representation has not been considered of so much importance in British\nColumbia as it has here. I have always\nI thought and stated as my opinion, that the\n| strength of British Columbia in the Confederation must consist in her weakness,\nthat in oraer to make the Dominion prosper,\nyou must make British Columbia prosper,\nand that therefore the whole country would\ncherish our interests, and that the main use\nof our representatives must be at first\nto give information as to a country of-\nwhich so little is known—as has been so\nclearly shown by the late debates. When\nour delegation came here last year our\nscheme proposed a representation in the Commons of eight members, proportioned to a\npopulation based on the customs revenue of\nthe country. This was reduced to six, and we\nnot unwillingly agreed to the reduction. But\nwe have never been able to appreciate that we\nwere bound by the British North America\nAct in this matter of representation, and had\nwe been told that we could have under that\nAct no representation, as I have heard argued,\nor only one member, we would have certainly\nsaid, \"Much obliged to you, we will remain a\nlittle longer as we are.\" (Hear, hear.) And\nnow with regard to\nTHE  RAILWAY  CIiAUSE\nof these terms. After all the rest of the\nscheme of union had been framed in Executive Council, it was unanimously agreed, and\nthis conclusion has been supported by the\nsentiment of the whole community, that\nthere could not be any real union with Canada without a material connection by the\nconstruction of a coach road first, to be followed at once by a railway. That was the\nconclusion arrived at by our Legislative\nCouncil in, 1870, and urged upon your Government by the British Columbia delegates\nas a sine qua non of our union. There was a\nvery great lack of confidence in Canada at\nthat time on the part of some members of the\nLegislative Council, and among the people of\nVictoria, not because those gentlemen, who\nwere nearly all Englishmen, had any leaning\ntowards the United States, but because they\nfeared that Canada was not in a position to\nundertake the construction of this material\nconnection by railway between British Columbia and this part of the Dominion. If\nCanada were not to make this connection,\nthen we might just as well seek union with\nAustralia or New Zealand (hear, hear.) If\nwe were only to become a mere isolated colony of Canada we had better remain as we\nwere, a separate colony of England. We argued \" If Canada is now ready to make\nthis railway, then let us join her at once,\nif not we shall do better to stay as we are\nuntil she is prepared to undertake the responsibility of that enterprise.\" We never\nthought of requiring the construction of this\nrailway as the price of our union with the\nDominion, but we\\had been told that Canada\nwas ready to build this railway, that it was a\n\t"

In the early part of these remarks\nI told you that, we in British Columbia had\nbeen led to expect, from the utterances of her\npublic men and from the views expressed by\nher journalists, that the union of British\nColumbia with the Dominion would have\nmet with the hearty approval of Ontaria, that\nthe construction at once of the Canadian\nPacific Railway would meet with her ready\nsupport, and I intimated to you, Sir, that I\nknew that British Columbia would be, as I\nwas, astonished at the position taken by many\nmembers of Parliament from Ontario. And\nin support of that position I pray you to allow me to read to you an extract from the\nBritish Colonist of the 15th March, published\nin Victoria, which I received three days\nsince. In a leading article our Victoria editor\nwrites as follow:\n\" British Columbia owes much, to the Toronto\nGlobe for the force find ability with which It has\nall along pre*ssed upon the Dominion of Canada\nthe necessity mi adopting a broad, vigorous, and\ntruly national policy with respect to throwing\nopen the great North West and pressing onward\nto the Pacific. Our big contemporary is doubtless not altogether free from faults and failings,\nbut this one virtue ought t'» cover a multitude of\nsins, to the eye of British Columbia at least. In\narecent number of the Globe weflnda very able\nleading article upon the subject of the Canadian\nPacific Railway. Our contemporary alludes to\nthe argument so commonly put forward by our\nAmerican neighbours, viz., that the American\nNorthern Pacific Railway, running, as it do's\nnear the boundary line, and draining, as it wi'l,\nth? British ossessions lying to the north of the\nforiy-ninth parallel, must forever forbid the idea\nof a Canadian Pacific line proving a success, if,\nindeed it does not forbid the idea of such a line\never iwinsr built. To this our contemporary the\nGi> be well replied:—\nI may remark that the following extract is\nquoted by our editor verbatim from the To-\nr. nto Globe of the 3rd Februaiy, as I have\nascertained by reference to a file of that\njournal :\n\"T .'• main line of th» North Pacific at no\npoint of its rout,\" approaches within a hundred\nand fifty miles of British territory, while in general it is at a much greater distance from the\nboundary Imp. supposing our great lak^s blotted\nout, and a wilderness of a hundred and fifty\nmi es stretching along the whole border line of\nOntaria, would any one argue that a railway far\ndown in Pennsylvania and New York would be\nquite sufficient io developp the resources of this\ncountry, and that all Canadian lines would be\nreally so much money thrown away ? Yet such\nan argument would not be so foolish and inconclusive as what is urged against the construction\nof a great Canadian Trans-Continental Railway.\n\"The proposed route of that undertaking is, on\nan average, four hundred miles north of that\nbeing made from Duiuth, and instead of being,\nas a large part of both the American lines must\nbe. through an irreclaimable desert, it runs\nthrough a country which, in fertility and climate, will com pare favorably with any part of\nthe North American Continent.\n\"When this, has been stated, nothing else is necessary. Any person of ordinary intelligence\ncan see at. a glance that a railway which never,\nthroughout its whole course comes within a\nhundred miles of the borderline of a country,\ncan do very little to delevope the resources of\nI that country. It is better than nothing, but this\nis a'l that c^n be said in its behalf. Tne immediate territory through which it runs would be\nbenefitted chiefly, and in the first place and\nall beyond only incidentally, and after the lapse\nof many years.\n\"inst-ad of the fact that the North Pacific is\nunder construe ion being an argument for Blowing the Canadian project to lie in the meanwhile in abeyance, it affords the strongest reason possible for its being pushed throi gh without delay. Politically it is a manifest and pressing necessity, whilp commercially It is as evidently of the very highest importance for Canada. I n i his way alone can this country have\nany chance for her fair share in hjprative trade\nwith the North-west which will assuredly spring\nup, and in the varied traffic with the Pacfic\nworld which to a great extent will pa«s through\nI Canadian territory, if one; what will be the\nshortest and easiest route from ocean to ocean is\nin working order.\"\nThe British Columbia editor on this remarks :\n\"Our readers will agree with the foregoing,\nwhile they will most heartily en orse and enthusiastically applaud the following paragraph\nwith which the Globe's article concludes :\n\"Our neighbours know the value of the prize\ninvolved, and are making giganlie efforts to secure it exclusively for themselves, uur rulers\nwill be traitors to their country and to Bri ish\nconnection if they lose a single season in making\nit practicable and convenient for settlers to go\nto hort Garry through our own territory) and in\nputting things in a fair way for the Canadian\nPacific Railway. It is a question not merely of\nconvenience but of national existence. It must\nbe pushed through at whatever expense. W'e\nbelieve it can be so pushed through, ' not only\nwithout being a burden pecuniarily upon Canada, but with an absolute profit in every point of\nview. Without such a line a great British North\nAmerica would turn out an unsubstantial\ndream; with it, and with ordinary prudence\nrnd wisdom on the part of her statesmen, it\nwill be a great, a glorious, and inevitable reality.\"\nI cannot imagine any stronger argument\nin favour of the immediate construction of\nthe proposed railway, by even its most enthusiastically interested British Columbian\nadvocates, than that here urged by the editor\nof the Toronto Globe. This work which he\nso pressingly insists on as a political necessity, and as of the highest commercial importance, we proposed to you to undertake ;\nand this work you have engaged to commence\nat once, and to complete at the earliest practicable period, that is to say, as we have estimated, in ten year* from the date of union.\nTHE  TEN TEARS'  LIMITATION.\nAnd now, Sir, I speak with special care, as I\ndesire that full weight should be given to\nevery word I utter on this point, that is to\nsay, as- to the understanding which I had\nwhen this clause was framed, and still have;\nof the intention of this engagement by the\nDominion to construct the Canadian Pacific\nRailway within ten years. When we came\nto you in June last,,we proposed that you\nshould build'at once a coach road from Fort\nGarry to the Pacific, and within three years\nbegin! a railway, and we sought to bind you\nto spend a million of dollars annually on the\nsection of this railroad in British Columbia,\nand to complete its construction with the\nutmost possible despatch.

            "as a matter of course, as a business necessity,\nand that instead of $1,000,000 being spent,\nprobably $5,000,000 would be yearly expended in British Columbia. We knew, in fact,\nthat if the road were to be completed at all,\nit would have to be proceeded with at a far\nfaster rate than a million a year would insure.\nBut there were those in British Columbia\nwho thought that Canada would not undertake the work at all, and it was to satisfy\ntheir doubts, to secure their adhesion to the\nscheme, that the guarantee of the expenditure of the $1,000,000 annually was asked.\nThe Government, on conference with our*\ndelegation, at once expressed their readiness\nto commence at once the railroad to the Pacific, and to complete it as soon as it was practicable to do so; but the coach road was objected to as an unnecessary expense, in view of the\nimmediate construction of a railroad. We\nfrom British Columbia were prepared to accept this amendment of the scheme, and wc\naccordingly proceeded to calculate the time\nit would probably take to build the railroad,\nand we agreed upon an estimated period of\nten years. If it had been put at twelve or\nfifteen years, British Columbia would\nhave been just as well satisfied,\nand if the estimated period had been reduced\nto eight years she would scarcely have been\nbetter pleased; but some definite period for\nthe completion of this work the British Columbia delegates insisted on as a necessary\nsafeguard to our colony in entering into the\nproposed union. To argue that any other\ninterpretation will be placed upon this railway engagement by British Columbia than\nthat which I have given to you as my construction of it,—to argue that she expects it\nto be carried out in the exact interpretation\nof the words themselves, regardless of all\nconsequences, is a fallacy which cannot bear\nthe test of common sense. (Hear, hear ) The\ncase stands thus : British Columbia is about\nto enter into a partnership with Canada, and\none of the terms of the articles of partnership is that we are under the partnership to\nconstruct a railway upon certain conditions.\nIs British Columbia going to hold her partner\nto that which will bring ruin and bankruptcy upon the firm? Surely you would\nthink us fools indeed if we adopted such a\ncourse. I would protest, and the whole of\nBritish Columbia would protest, if the government proposed to borrow $100,000,000 or\nS150,000,000 to construct this road; (hear,\nhear,) running the country into debt, and\ntaxing the people of British Columbia as well\nas of the rest of the Dominion to pay the\nburden of such a debt. Why, sir, I heard it\nsaid the other evening that British Columbia\nhad made a most Jewish bargain with you in\nthese terms, but even Shylock himself would\nnot exact his pound of flesh if a portion of it\nhad to be cut from his own body. (Lcud\ncheers and laughter.) I am sure that you\nwill find that British Columbia is a pretty\nintelligent community, which will be apt to\nfake a business view of this matter. She\nwill expect that this railway shall be com-\n1 menced in two years, for that is clearly\npracticable; and she will also expect that\nI the financial ability of the Dominion will be\nj exerted to its utmost, within the limits of\nreason, to complete it in the time named in\nthe agreement; but you may rest assured\nthat she will not regard this railway engagement as a \" cast-iron contract,\" as it has been\ncalled, or desire that it should be carried out\nin any other way than as will secure the\nprosperity of the'whole Dominion of which\nshe is to be a part. (Cheers.) I have understood this railway engagement in this way\nfrom the first, and I still so understand it.\nI believed when we negotiated this clause in\nthe terms of union last year, and I now believe, that it is not only practicable for this\nroad to be built by a liberal land grant and\na moderate money subsidy, but that it will\nbe so built and completed within the estimated period of ten years But if a mistake\nhas been made in this estimate, do not thiuk\nthat British Columbia is going to put a\nstrained interpretation upon the agreement,\nto her own material injury; that she is likely,\nas the saying is, to bite her own nose off to\nspite her face.\nESTIMATED  COST  OP THE RAILWAY.\nI will enter into no estimate to-night\nof the cost of the section of the proposed road east of the Rocky Mountains.\nYou have as good means of forming opinions\non the probable expenditure that will be required on this portion of the line as I have.\nBut I will speak of the probable cost of the\nline in British Columbia through a country\nwith which I am personally acquainted.\nBritish Columbia, Sii, is not such an unknown, unexplored country as it has been\nsupposed or represented to be. I may mention to you that in 1865 and 1866, in obedience to a despatch from the Secretary of\nState, asking for information regarding\nthe facilities for the construction of a\nwaggon road across the mountains, to connect with the Red River settlement, I instituted, under the Governor's direction, explo- !\nrations of the country between Fraser River\nand the Rocky Mountain range, and the report of these explorations, together wit^i.a\nminute from myself thereon, summing\nup all the information then obtainable,\nwere printed and have been made public.\nIt is, I think, pretty certain that the choice\nfor the line through the Rocky Mountains is\nbetween Leather Pass and Howse's Pass; but\nfrom the Western outlet of either of those\npasses, there are several lines of route to the\nPacific, and I do not prttend now to offer\nany opinion as to the relative merits of these\nseveral lines. I will speak only of that\none which I am most acquainted with, having passed over nearly this whole line from\nthe Pacific to the Rocky Mountains, on horseback or on foot, and over parts of it frequently. I mean a line from the mouth of the\nFraser, following up the course of that river\nand of one of its tributaries, the Thompson,\nto the head waters of the south branch of"

This is not only a practicable\nline but it will give a gradual ascent to the\nsummit of the Rocky Mountains, from which\npoint the descent to the Red River will be\nalmost a regular incline, in very favorable\ncomparison with the grade of the road now\nin operatien between San Francisco and\nOmaha, which passes over four successive\nI summits, the lowest of which is two thou-\nr sand feet higher than that we have to over-\n1 come on the Rocky Mountains. Now, Sir,\nin the absence of detailed surveys and sections, no one can make a close estimate of\nthe cost of this line; but I venture to express my opinion in which I am supported by\nother gentlemen, like myself engineers, who\nhave gone over the line, that notwithstanding some portions of the work on this road\nalong the Canon of the Fraser would be\nvery expensive, the whole distance from the\nPacific seaboard to the summit of the Rocky\nMountains, a distance of about six hundred\nmiles, may be set down at an approximate estimate of  $60,000   per  mile.\nRESULT OP DEFEAT OP UNION.\nI have been frequently asked of late—and I\nmention this point as it has been discussed\nso warmly in Parliament. \" What would\nhave been the result in British Columbia had\nthe address in favor of her union with Canada\nbeen voted down ?\" Well, Sir, as I have\nsaid already this evening, the people of British- Columbia are not only an intelligent but\na loyal community—throughout the whole\ncountry there exists strong attachment to\n-British connection. They have never as a\npeople had any inclination for the United\nStates or any proclivity toward the institutions of that country; and though there-was\nat one time in the year before last an attempt\non the part of a few disaffected persons to\nraise such an issue, it was so speedily hooted\ndown thatthe very word annexation has\nbeen ever since taboed among us. But,\nhad this address not been carried there would\nhave been the deepest disappointment\nthroughout our colony and profound discouragement to the best friends there of Confederation. Our people have been given to\nunderstand from all quarters in Canada as I\nbefore told you that the Canadian Pacific\nRailway was to be built at once—they have\nregarded their union with Canada on the\nterms arranged by your'Goyernment as afore-\ngone conclusion—and had they been told by\nyou as they would in fact have been told by\nycur refusal to confirm those terms, \" we\nare not able to undertake the building of\nthis Railway, we are not prepared to take the\nresponsbility of uniting British Columbia\nto us, not equal to the occasion which presents itself,\" they would certainly with embittered   feelings have at once and unani\nmously refused to unite with you on any\nother terms, and what might have been the\nultimate rosult I would prefer not to conjecture. But, Sir, happily we have escaped any\nsuch risk as this would have occasioned to\nthe consolidation of British interests on this\ncontinent, and are met here to-night to rejoice over the consummation of the great\nwork of the union of British Columbia to the Dominion. (Cheers.)\nI must apologise for the length of these\nremarks on a social occasion such as this is,\nbut there were some points with regard to\nthe true bearing and intention of the terms\nof union of our colony with Canada which I\nhave considered it very desirable, not only\nfor the sake of our community, but\" in the\ninterest of this whole Dominion, to comment\non, and explain from a British Columbia\npoint of view, and I have availed myself of\nthis opportunity of doing so as I see no probability of any other being afforded me just\nnow. And now, sir, I beg to renew my acknowledgements of-the high compliment paid this\nevening to British Columbia in the person\nof her representative. For myself I can only\nassure you that I shall ever cherish a grateful recollection of the very great kindness\nwhich I have received from the many friends\nwith whom I have had the pleasure of becoming acquainted in Canada, and especially,\nMr. Chairman, from yourself. On behalf of\nthe people of British Columbia—the youngest of the fair sisterhood of federated provinces now spread across this broad continent\nfrom ocean to ocean—I express the heartfelt\ndesire—long may this goodly Dominion\nflourish and grow in honor among the nations under the dear old flag that now waves\nover us—enjoying year by year an increasing\nmeasure of material prosperity, and truest\nhappiness 1 and in direct connection with this\nsentiment I propose to you in the name of\nour colony a toast which I know needs no\nfurther preface here to-night—to those to\nwhom British Columbia and this whole Dominion owe so much—\" Her Majesty's Ministers.\"   (Loud and prolonged cheers.)\nThe toast having been enthusiastically\ndrank,\nSir G. E. Cartier, on behalf of his colleagues and himself, returned their most sincere thanks. With regard to this present\nministry it should be borne in mind that it\nwas the offspring of Confederation. From\nthe 1st of July, 1867, it had been the task of\nthe ministry ever to extend the incomplete\nscheme of Oonfederation. It was their happy lot to-day to see this in a measure completed.   (Hear, hear, and cheers.)\nHon. Mr. Campbell said that he was happy\nto submit to Sir George's response for the\nministry. He was sure they were all delighted that Sir George had been so happy in leading during the absence of Sir John. (Hear.)\nThe mottoe of the present ministry had ever\nbeen \" One Queen, one flag, one destiny.\"\n(Loud cheers.) That had been the feeling\nwhich had influenced them, and when they"

Dr. Tupper, alluded to the rapid\nstrides which had been made in this country.\nWho, he said, in 1867 would have dreamt\ntbat they would have been enabled to night\nto celebrate the admission of British Columbia into the union. (Cheers.) He would\nnot add a single word to what had been al\nready said by the leader of the Government.\nHe begged permission to offer a volunteer\ntoast that of \" our sister Province Manitoba,\"\n•the representatives of which they had for\nthe first time sitting with them at the\nfestive board.\nThe   toast having   been  enthusiastically\nhonoured,\nDr. Sohultz, who was warmly received on\nrising, said that as \" Manitoba\" was not on\nthe list of proposed toasts he had not expected to have had the honor to reply on behalf\nof the Province, a portion of which he had\nthe honor to represent. Still, since they had\nchosen to do honor to the Prarie Province,\nhe would say something on her behalf. He\nhad listened with a very great deal of plea-\nenre to the remarks of their honored guest,\nMr. Truteh, and he felt that hon. gentleman\nhad made out a very strong and very satisfactory case in favor of our newly acquired\nProvince of British Columbia. (Hear, hear.)\nHe felt especially pleased to meet Mr. Truteh\nen this festive occasion, because he felt tbat\nit would probably be the last time he could\nmeet him in friendship. (Laughter.) It\nwas quite evident to him that the two West-\nem Provinces were to be rivals, and that\nwhen he met Mr. Truteh on the floor of the\nHouse of Commons next year each one would\ninsist on the special advantages ,which his\nProvince offered, and that there would be an\nantagonism which he trusted would not result disastrously. (Laughter.) While they\nwere yet friends, therefore, he must congratulate the hon. gentleman who had setfbe-\nfore them so clearly the somewhat intricate\nstate of affairs in the Province he represent-\njed. Mr. Truteh had dwelt upon the wealth\nof British Columbia in its fisheries, its coal\nfields, its timber and its gold. Well, Manitoba had something to offer too, or rather\nwould have when its boundaries were extended. It had its fisheries not to be despised;\nit had its gold fields, though people could\nnot as yet pick up nuggets as in British Columbia. (Laughter.) Still there were those\nwho when washing the shining sands of the\nUpper Saskatchewan argued that on our side\nof the Rocky Mountains there existed the\nmatrix from which these golden grains had\ndrifted. What Manitoba however had chiefly\nto offer to the Dominion was agricultural re-|\nsources, homes to the immigrant, a yield of,\ngrain unequalled in any country. What British Columbia seemed to need was wealth—\nwhat Manitoba needed was population. He\nwas willing that Mr. Truteh should get for\nhis Province all the capitalists if he could\n•.secure for Manitoba that immigration which\nher natural resources gave her the right to\nexpect. He felt very hopeful about the future of his Province. Indeed since the acquisition of British Columbia he had begun\nto take very large views ; he was even beginning to think that the capitol was not central enough in the new Dominion. (Laughter.) He would not be surprised if many\nof us lived to see the Capitol removed to\nsome place in the valley of Sackatchewan\nnow occupied only by the roaming tribes of\nthat region. The only want which Manitoba\nhad besides population was communication,\nand it was with great pleasure he learned on\nhis arrival in Canada that the Pacific Railway had been legislated and determined\nupon. (Cheers.) He looked upon the acquisition of these western Provinces in the light\nof an investment, profitable if their resources\nwere developed, useless if not, and a Railroad was the only way to develop them. Without Railroad communication, he considered\nthe £300,000, expended for its purchase, the\ntwo million dollars spent to put down rebellion, and the proposed payment of $67,000 a\nyear for the support of its Government, as\njust so much means squandered, so much\nmoney sunk for no possible good. (Cheers.)\nHad we railroad communication, we couid\nenter the emigrant centres of the old world\nand fairly bid, and even outbid all competitors. Could we at a reasonable cost transport the emigrant into Manitoba, we could\noffer him 160 acres of better prairie land that\ncan be found in the Western States, free. We\ncan Offer him the fnll privileges of citizenship after three years residence, instead of\nthe five years insisted on further South. We\ncan offer him a country where taxes are\nscarcely known, where such necessaries of\nlife, as could not be produced on his own\nfields or manufactured by himself, can be\nbought at one-half the cost of those articles\nin the much lauded Western States Where,\nin addition he may expect an average yield\none-third greater than that of the most productive grain raising State of the Union.\n(Cheers.) Could we be assured of receiving\nsuch an immigration then, it seemed to\nhim that success is certain. It is all\nright for us, to have these Eastern Pro- ■\nvinces depleted for our benefit, but there\nis, in that, no substantial advantage to\nthe Dominion at large. To use the immense resources we must have increased population, and with that, will come wealth\nrapidly enough. We must in building up a\nnation not depend alone on our own population and the emigrant class of the British .\nIsles, we must have our share, a monopoly\neven, if we can get it, of that Scandinavian\nand German element which is building up the\nnation south of us. (Cheers.) In conclusion\nDr. Schultz thanked the assembly for the\ngood feeling they expressed towards Manitoba, he felt convinced that they would not\nfind that Province to be the weakest nor the\npoorest of that chain which now girdled the\ncontinent; and if this great scheme that we\nhave set on foot, this effort to establish on\n\t"

            ">*m\nthis continent a great and prosperous British\npower; if it should so unfortunately happen\nthat this scheme should be frustrated, this\nlaudable effort fail, he felt certain that its\nfailure will have to be ascribed to some other\ncause than a lack of natural resources, in\nthat Confederation which now extends from\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific and which embraces a territory greater than that of half\nthe Kingdoms of Europe, or that of our natural rivals, the United States.   (Cheers.)\nMr. Smith, M. P. for Selkirk, Manitoba,\nafter repeated calls, rose and said that, after\nwhat had fallen from the gentleman who had\npreceded him, there was little more to be\nsaid. As it had been determined that they\nwere to have a railway connection with this\ncountry, he would say something about the\nroute. It had been said that the route from\nFort Garry to Canada was almost impracticable. He believed, from what he could\nlearn from people who had traversed that\nroute, that this was not the case. (Hear,\nhear.) By following the old route taken by\nthe Hudson's Bay Company's officials, going\nbehind Nipissing, touching Nepigon, and\nskirting Lasalle, they would be able to pass\nthrough a country, certainly not quite equal\nto some portions of the Dominion, but, both\nas regarded climate and soil, not inferior to\nmuch of the country through which the Intercolonial Railway runs. At the Lake of the\nWoods they reached the prairie, which extended for fourteen hundred miles to the\nwestward, and afforded facilities for the construction of a railway unequalled by that\nthrough which any railway in the Dominion\npassed. (Hear, hear.) Then as to the resources of the country. They possessed large\nfisheries, and though they might not have a\nfish with the colour of a salmon, they had the\nwhite fish, which was far superior in flavour.\nThey, too, had found nuggets of gold, and\nthey were possessed of salt mines, which\nwere sufficient to supply the whole Dominion. There were large beds of coal, too,\non the Assiniboine and the Saskatchewan,\nand a great deal of coal oil somewhat\nnorth; and, besides, there were copper, iron, lead, &c, in abundance,\nand in the Pran River district they have a\ncountry quite equal to that of the Saskatchewan, and a climate which admitted of win\ntering herds of cattle out in the prairies,\nwhere they grazed throughout the whole\nyear, instead of being obliged to staUfeed\nthem for at least four months, as is the case\nboth in Ontario and Quebec (cheers). It had\nbeen supposed that the great difficulty in'\nManitoba was the lack of building material.\nBut the fact was that the shores of Lake\nWinnipeg would supply large quantities of\nexcellent granite and stone, and there were\nalso extensive beds of clay, which could be\nused for the manufacture of bricks, and during the last year a considerable quantity of\nbricks had been made. He thought, therefore, that for building material theyweie\npretty well off. (Hear, hear.) He believed\nthat during the coming years two steamers\nwould be running on Red River, for a distance of 160 miles, which would connect\nthat country with the railway system of the\nUnited States. On the Lake Manitoba (from\nwhich to Fort Garry the distance was only\nsixty miles over a perfectly level country)\nand the Saskatchewan River there would\ndoubtless also be steamers within a couple\nof years, thus to a certain extent opening up\nand giving the means of bringing down the\ncoal and other products of that extensive and\nvaluable district—but the great desideratum-\nwas railway communication; and he believed\nthat within the ten years spoken of the\nrailway would be built, and that the friends\nof those people who were going from Ontario\nand Quebec to Manitoba would not let the\nmatter rest, but would press forward as\nrapidly as possible the railway to the North\nWest.   (Loud cheers.)\nSir George Cartier then proposed the\nhealth of the speakers of the two Houses of\nParliament, regretting that domestic affliction\nprevented the attendance of the speaker of\nthe Senate.\nHon. Mr. Cockburn, Speaker of the House\nof Commons, responded in his usual happy\nfe train.\nThen followed \" the Press \" to which Mr..\nThomas White of the Gazette responded, and\n\"the ladies\" responded to by Mr. Savary. \"The\nchairman \" was proposed by Mr. Grant M.P.,\nand after the toast had been duly honoured,,\nthe band played God Save the Queen, and\nthe company separated.\nt"

Mr. Truteh, Surveyor General of British Columbia, on the evening of the 10th April instant, at the\nEussell House, Ottawa. . The dinner was\nparticipated in by Ministers and by members of both Houses, who, having aided\nin the work of Union, met together to\ncongratulate each other upon what they\nhad accomplished, and to do honour to\nour new sister Colony in the person of her\nrepresentative. Among those who were present were many who, in various capacities,\nhave been warm supporters of that policy\nwhich has resulted in the practical admission of British Columbia and ^the extension\nof the boundaries of the Dominion to the far\naway shores of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe large dining room was decorated in a\nvery tasteful manner with flags, evergreens,\nand appropriate mottoes; among \"the latter\nwe noticed\n\"Westward the march of Empire takes its\nway.\"\n\"The Star of Empire glitters in the \"West.\"\n\"One Queen, one Flag, one Destiny, one\nEmpire.\"\n\"British Connection.\"\n\"Vis unita Fortior.\"\n\"Quis separabit ?\"\n\"A Pacific Kail way.\"\n\" Ontario ;\" '' Quebec ;\" \" New Brunswick;\"\nI Nova Scotia;\" \" Manitoba ;\" ■\" British Columbia ;\" together with several others.\nGowan's band was in attendance in the\ngallery, and did much to promote the enjoyment of the evening by the performance of\nsome excellent music.\nAt eight o'clock the guests walked into\nthe hall to the number of about 200, and\nseated themselves at the tables.\nThe chair was occupied by Sir G. E. Car-\ntier. On his right was Mr. Truteh, and on\nhis left, Hon. Mr. Cockburn, Speaker of the\nHouse of Commons.    The  vice chairs were\noccupied by Mr. Angus Morrison, M.P., and\nMr. Alonzo Wright, MP.\n.When justice had been done to the very\nexcellent dinner provided, the chairman rose\nand proposed the first toast, which was drunk\nwith the usual loyal honors.\nI The Queen.\"\nBand—\" God save the Queen.\"\nThe next toast was \" the Prince and Princess of Wales and the rest of the Boyal\nFamily.\"\nBand—\" The Bed White and Blue.\"\nSir G. E.~Cabtier then proposed the Army,\nNavy, and Volunteers. He might be considered as too intimately connected with the\nlatter to propose a toast of the kind with\npropriety, but he might, at all events, say\nthat the volunteers of Canada had on more\nthan one occasion during the past few years\nbeen called upon to defend their country and\nthey had done so bravely and nobly, and like\npatriotic men (cheers).\nBand—\" British Grenadiers.\"\nLt-Col. Chamberun, C.M.G., in response to\nan unanimous call responded, saying that he\nthanked the company most heartily for the\nhonor done to the volunteers. In presence.\nof the chief of the Canadian Navy and also of\nan officer of the British regular army (Captain Cameron) he could not say anything on\nbehalf of those branches of the service, but\nspeaking for the volunteers he could,without\nany hesitation, testify to the gratification\nthey experienced at having the services which\nthey had rendered in defence of the Empire\nso heartily recognized, and also at finding\ntheir brother volunteers and fellow subjects,\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific, united with\nthem in the glorious privilege of defending\nthe flag of the Empire.    (Cheers.)\nCaptain Cameron was also called upon\nto respond. He said he regretted that a\ndistinguished volunteer officer like Colonel\nChamberlin had not undertaken to speak on.\nbehalf of the regular army- as well as for the\nvolunteers. He alluded to the Imperial\npolicy of withdrawing the troops from Can a- da, and to the doubts which that policy seem-1\ned to have given rise to in the minds of Canadians.   These doubts are very painful toi\nImperial officers, who know perfectly well\nthat the old English heart still beats beneath\nthe English breast. (Cheers.)   The Imperial\nGovernment- had  a right to withdraw the\ntroops from Canada, and to pursue a policy |\nof concentration  which   any military man\nwould say was a wise one.   But Britain would\nnot forget her children. (Cheers.)\nCommodore Forth? replied on behalf of the\nNavy. He said he was not a member of the\nBoyal navy, but only of the Provincial\nnavy, which was a comparatively small\naffair. Still it must be remembered that a\nnavy did not consist in ships alone, but in\nthe bone and muscle of its sailors, and in\nthe eighty thousand fishermen whom Canada possessed lay the strength of the Canadian navy.   (Cheers.)\nHon. Mr. Mitchell also replied on behalf of\nthe navy. He said that the events of the\npast years had shown that the navy of Canada was of some account, and as for the Royal\nNavy that great and glorious service which\nhas done so much to uphold the honor of the\nEmpire for years past, its fame was world\nwide.    (Cheers.;\nSir George E. Cartier then rose and said\nhe had now to propose the toast of the even-\nin et, \"Our Guest •' the Honorable Mr. Truteh.\nBefore doing so, however, he hoped to be allowed to make a few observations. Lust\nyear we achieved a great deal in extending\nthe boundaries of the Dominion a» far as the\nRocky Mountains. That was a great and\ndifficult work to accomplish, but it was merely an extension of the territorial limits of the\nDominion. Now they had achieved a greater\nwork, they had carried the limits of Canada\nas far as they could go in a westerly direction,\nand the end attained was worth the struggle.\n(Cheers.) Since Mr. Truteh had been in\nCanada he bad won many friends, but he\n(Sir George Carrier) and his colleagues bad\nbetter opportunities than any one else to\nform a more intimate acquaintance with him,\nand British Columbia, he was quite sure, could\nnot have a better representative. He regretted that the two gentlemen who accompanied him as delegates last summer were not\nwith him. Still, he could not help feeling\nthat they enjoyed a great pleasure in having\nMr. Trntch, one of the leading members of\nthe British Columbia Executive-Council, present with them (cheers). We have had our\nstruggle and are now rejoicing over our success, but we must not forget that Mr. Truteh\nand his colleagues have been battling for\nUnion for years. Our triumph was his\ntriumph also, and it was our duty to congratulate and do honour to him (cheers).\nHe (Sir George Cartier) could not forget that\n300 years ago a bold navigator set sail westward to discover a way to the eastern coast\nof Asia. His name was Jacques Cartier\n(cheers). He was followed by Champlain\nand La Salle, and when the latter left the\nplace where now stands the village of La-\nchine, seven miles from Montreal, he said as\nhe sailed westward that he was \"off for\nChina.\" The Canada of which these early\nsettlers dreamed was not a Lower Canada,\nbut a Canada that should really extend to\nChina (cheers). The Canada which we are\nestablishing to-day is the Canada which they\ndesired to see, one that should extend from\nocean to ocean (cheers).\nBand—\" For he's a jolly good fellow.\"\nMr. Teutch then rose and replied as follows :—\nI thank you most heartily, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, for the great honour\nyou have to-night conferred on British\nColumbia through her representative, and\nmy personal acknowledgments are especially due to you, Sir, for the flattering\nterms in which you have spoken of me. I\nam well aware that I am all undeserving of\nthe high encomiums which your politeness\nhas led you to bestow on me. As an Englishman—a loyal British subject—and as a true\nfriend of Briti.sh Columbia, the home of my\nadoption for the past 12 years, my heart has\nbeen thoroughly in the work of extending\nthe Dominion of Canada to the Pacific. But\nI can assume no other merit than this—if\nindeed there can be any merit in the performance of a simple and most pleasurable duty—\nthat I have laboured earnestly under the direction of our most excellent and able Governor, Mr. Musgrave, to promote that great object now so happily attained. But it is not\nthe less gratifying to me, sir, to be the recipient of the cordial welcome extended here\nto-night to British Columbia in the person of\nher representative on her entrance into this\nCon federation of British North America ; a\nwelcome which, I can assure you, will be\nmost gratefully appreciated in that country,\nand cannot fail to draw closer the bonds of\nunion between our community and the people of Canada. Well knowing as I do that I\nam expressing the sentiments of joyful gratitude which possess the entire British population of our colony at this moment, I tender\ntheir thanks to those gentlemen whose votes\nhave secured for us the consummation of our\nhopes and aspirations ; and I congratulate\nyou, Mr. Chairman, and your honourable colleagues in the Dominion Government, on\nyour far-sighted statemanship in bringing\nthis measure, so entirely in accord with the\nclearly enunciated wishes of the Imperial\nGovernment, to a successful issue, undeterred\nby the strenuous opposition urged against it -\nand I confidently express my belief, that as\nthe true merits of this measure are more\nthoroughly understood, as the baselessness\nand fallacy of the objections to the terms of\nour Union, and particularly to the railway\nengagement, are realized throughout the\ncountry, the policy of your Government will\nbe more and more generally and thankfully\nsustained.   (Cheers.)\nTHE  OPPOSITION*  FROM  OXTARIO.\nIt would ill become me, Sir, a  stranger\noccupying the position I do, to offer any 5\ncriticism   hostile  to   the   action   of  those\nwho placed themselves in antagonism to this\nmeasure.   I can fully believe that those gentlemen took that position in the conscientious discharge of their duty.   But having\nlistened to the whole of the debate on this\nsubject, having taken part in the arrangement of the terms  discussed,   and having\nspecial local acquaintance with the facts involved, I think I may be permitted, indeed I\nconsider it my duty, to comment on some of\nthe objections and arguments urged against\nthe passage of this measure, with the view of\nremoving   misapprehension.     And   in   the\nfirst place I desire to say that in British Columbia, we have been led to understand most\ndistinctly from the utterances of public men.\nand from the opinions enunciated in leading\njournals in Ontario, that from that quarter at\nleast we  should have no opposition.   We\nwere aware that there-»were in this country,\nsome, who   having   opposed Confederation\nfrom its inception, were still hostile to that\ngreat and good measure, or at best doubtful\nfriends   to   its   accomplishment, convinced\nagainst their will but of the same opinion\nstill, and  from those gentlemen we anticipated antagonism to our Union with the Dominion.    But the people of Ontario we have\nregarded as our natural allies in this connection, and we supposed that the leaders of\npolitical parties in that province would unite\nin extending confederation westward on any\nreasonable terms which might be laid before\nthem.     During the  course of this debate I\nhave heard many statements made and opinions expressed depreciatory,  and as it appeared to me extravagantly depreciatory, of\nour country and our people.    (Hear, hear.)\nI believe that those statements were made\nhonestly though upon false information. But\nnot the less do I regret that those statements\nare about to inflict much mortification and\nbitterness of heart upon the people  of our\ncountry.     They cannot know the   circumstances under which these statements were\nuttered, and will not therefore make allowances for those who uttered them as I do.    I\nhave never believed that it was a part of my\nmission here to vaunt the material wealth of\nour country, to extol its excellence, or in any\nway to press British Columbia upon Canada.\nBut I think it is necessary,  after what has\nbeen said, to give you gentlemen here present some just idea of the wealth and worth\nof   our   country.     This   is    no    occasion\nfor   attempting   any   detailed    description\nor statistical essiy on British Columbia, but\nI will endeavor to sketch with as few touches\nas possible,\nTHE LEADING FEATURES OP THE COUNTRY.\nThe position of British Columbia you are\nall well acquainted with, commanding, asl\nit does, not only the trade of the Western\ncontinent of America, and the islands of the\nPacific, but also that of the Trans-Pacific\ncountries. It has a sea coast extending 500\nmiles in a straight line, with a labyrinth of\nislands along its whole length, forming innu-\nimerable harbours, inlets and canals, together\nI with the rivers which empty into them teeming with fish—salmon,sturgeon, mackerel, cod,\nherring, hallibut, oolachans, and last but not\nleast, with whales. These fisheries are a\nsource of wealth at present totally undeveloped with us. We know only of its boundless richness, but except a small beginning in\nwhale fishery, nothing has as yet been done\nto render merchantable these immense resources. Then our forests, extending all\nalong the coast and river courses, of vast extents of timber excellent in quality, and, from\nI their proximity to water carriage, most\nvaluable for shipbuilding and lumbering purposes. This industry in British Columbia\nhas latterly effected a good start, as appears\nfrom the official returns for 1869, that in that\nyear lumber amounting in value to $250,000\nwas exported. Our coal fields too are of\nvast extent—of bituminous coal in Vancouver's Island, along the coast of the mainland\nand 200 miles in the interior of the country.\n| These have been worked to some extent for\nsome years past, and iu 1869, $125,000 worth\nof coal was exported to San Francisco. We\nhave also that which some think more valuable than bituminous coal. In Queen\nCharlotte's Island large deposits of anthracite\ncoal have been discovered, and of this a sample was this year introduced into San Francisco and is now selling at $17.00 a ton as I\nlearn from San Francisco papers. California\nhas very little coal within her own limits,\nand what there exists is of the poorest quality. She is therefore almost altogether supplied by British Columbia, and strange to\nsay, to some extent from Australia. Then\nin 1869 our exports of furs and hides\namounted to $264,000. We possess, also,\nminerals of almost every description. In\nfact, I hardly know of any that have not been\nfound in our country. The gold exported in\n1,867 amounted to a million and a half of dollars ; and we have besides, silver, iron, copper,\nlead, and many other minerals of less importance. Building materials, too, abound; as\nlime, marble, freestone, slate, cement, &c.\nAnd now with regard to lands, I would like\nto speak very carefully, as there appears such\nconflict of opinion here on this point. It is\ntrue, as has been stated, that the country is\nmuch broken up by intersecting mountain\nranges. But it must be remembered that all\nis not mountainous. We have a very large\nquantity of valuable land,available for agricultural and pastoral purposes in British Columbia on the high plateaus and interspersed\namongst the valleys, capable of supporting a\nvery large population, and though not perhaps\nconstituting what may be called,strictly speaking, an agricultural country, yet amounting,\nI think, to from a fourth to a third of the country, a good portion of which is now under\ncultivation, and yields heavy crops of grain\nand roots. As to the climate I am almost\nafraid to touch upon it. It possesses such a\ncharm for one who has experienced it; varying as it does from the humid West of England climate of Vancouver's Island and the done with our own money, not a penny have i\nwe ever had from England. The road which I\nwe have built from the head of the navigation\non the Lower Fraser, to Cariboo cost us a\nmillion and a half dollars. It is wrong to\nsay that any portion of the population is nomadic. Such is not the case. There are\nsome two thousand miners who work steadily\nin the mining district the year round—they\ncannot be called nomadic, and the rest of the\npopulation are farmers for the most part or\ntraders, or professional men, and small as the\ncommunity is, it is, I believe as intelligent,\nhardworking and loyal to the British Flag as\nany in Canada.   (Cheers.)\nTHE UNION QUESTION IN THE COLONY.\nPermit me now to trace the history of Confederation in British Columbia,\nand to review the position of the question^\nthere at the present time. In March 1867,\nwhile your delegates were in London, completing the negotiations which resulted in the present British North America Act, our Legislative Council, then composed of fourteen\nofficial and nine selected members, but all appointed by the Governor, being in session, passed an unanimous resolution praying that they might be allowed\nthe opportunity of entering the Confederation at some future day on terms fair and\nequitable. And that sentiment exists to-day\nand to an increased degree. (Hear, hear, and\ncheers.) This resolution was telegraphed by\nsome parts of the country, but even along the I our Governor to the Secretary of State. I\nmain road the cost of carrying freight from know not whether this resolution was in-\nthe sea coast to Cariboo is fifteen cents a strumental in causing the 146th section to\npound. Six dollars a day is considered poor be inserted in the British North America Act,\nman's digging there, and wages are mainly but shortly after our message was sentare-\nfrom this cause proportionately high. There ply was received informing us that provision\nis another reason which I think has operated had been made for our admittance into the\nalmost as largely against our obtaining any Confederation. In 1868, resolutions were\nincrease of population. Up to this year inopportunely introduced into our legisla-\nBritish Columbia has been a Crown colony, ture praying for immediate confederation\nwith a government, so to speak, despotic, with Canada; but in view of the fact that the\nthere being no popular representative body, great North-West was still unconnected with\nSuch a form of government is supremely dis- the Dominion, this movement was voted pre-\ntasteful to any Anglo Saxon community, and mature and impracticable.

I have pointed\nout to you sufficient material resources and\nadvantages to show that apart from its political value to Canada, this is a country worth\nhaving. (Hear, hear, and cheers.) And I\nknow no reason why this country, now separ\nrated and isolated, should not become\na source of great wealth to this Dominion.   (Hear, hear.)\nWHY BRITISH COLUMBIA HAS NOT PROSPERED.\nBut it has been asked why is it that\nyou have so small a population in this\ncountry ? Vou have not far to seek for\nthe answer. To my mind the reasons\nare very plain and very simple. British\nColumbia is a most isolated country, cut off\nfrom Great Britain by a sea voyage of 150\ndays, and walled in to the east by the Rocky\nMountains, preventing all communication\nwith this country, and still more shut off on\nthe south by the United States, through\nwhich all immigrants to British Columbia\nhave to .pass. We know what is done in San\nFrancisco to prevent those immigrants from\ncoming to us,—how our eountry, government, and institutions are misrepresented.\nAnother difficulty is its inaccessibility.\nGood roads have, to be sure, been made to\nman for  man with\nAnd I adduce to you as a proof of. what I\nhave said what has already been done in that\ncolony still in its cradle.

These\neastern portion of this continent to compare assurances have been strictly fulfilled. The\nwith our coach roads; and  all this we have | terms of Union   agreed upon between the\nI delegates from British Columbia and the Dominion Government last year, were submitted\non the 18th! of last January, to a Legislative\nCouncil, composed of nine representatives\nand six appointed members, and unanimously\nadopted. (Cheers) I should now like to\nspeak about\nTHE  TERMS  OF UNION  THEMSELVES\nand show you how they appear\nfrom a British Columbian point of\nview, and I will confine myself to the questions of the financial arrangements, the representation and the railway undertaking—the\nonly points which were really opposed during the discussion in Parliament. I will first\nspeak off the financial arrangement, and with\nyour permission, I will take you back to the\ntime when the scheme was first discussed in\nthe Executive Council of British Columbia.\nAs soon as we came to consider the question\nof terms we arrived at the conclusion that\nno scheme based on the actual population of\nthe country was capable of being adopted ;\nthat it was simply impossible that we should\nreceive a sufficient subsidy on those conditions to carry on the affairs of the Province,\nand that it was impossible to proceed according to the strict terms of the British North\nAmerican Act in this respect. Having arrived at this conclusion, that by some means\nwe must have a certain sum of money, we\nresolved to adopt a fictitious scheme, based\nupon the customs revenue of the country.\nThis scheme was rejected by your government\nin conference with our delegation last June,\nand I think properly so, but we then insisted\nthat we must have a certain sum of money,\nand urged that it was unwise to cut the\nmeans of the Colony down below the revenue actually required for necessary\nexpenditures, as the Dominion would only\nultimately find itself obliged to make a more\nliberal arrangement;- and we pointed out that\nthe Colony was giving up the only elastic\nsource of revenue which we have—the Custom's revenue—the only source of revenue\ncapable of meeting the growing requirements\nof the people, and that even if we got at\nfirst more subsidy than our population en\ntitled us to, year by year as our numbers increased the Dominion would get the better\nbargain financially. It was then proposed\nthat for the land to be made over by the\nColony for the construction of the railway,\nwe should get a certain sum of $100,000 annually, and to this arrangement we assented.\nA false impression has been created on this\npoint. We came here last year willing\nenough to give any reasonable amount of\nland in aid of the- railway, and asked no\ncompensation for it. But it should be borne\nin mind that the extent of land to be contributed by British Columbia for this object,\nis manifold greater in proportion to her\npopulation than that to be supplied by Ontario or by the Dominion, whose people are\nequally interested with us in this railroad enterprise, and it cannot therefore be justly\nheld that we drove a hard bargain in this\nmatter. (Hear, hear.) I assure you that the\nquestion of representation has not been considered of so much importance in British\nColumbia as it has here. I have always\nI thought and stated as my opinion, that the\n| strength of British Columbia in the Confederation must consist in her weakness,\nthat in oraer to make the Dominion prosper,\nyou must make British Columbia prosper,\nand that therefore the whole country would\ncherish our interests, and that the main use\nof our representatives must be at first\nto give information as to a country of-\nwhich so little is known—as has been so\nclearly shown by the late debates. When\nour delegation came here last year our\nscheme proposed a representation in the Commons of eight members, proportioned to a\npopulation based on the customs revenue of\nthe country. This was reduced to six, and we\nnot unwillingly agreed to the reduction. But\nwe have never been able to appreciate that we\nwere bound by the British North America\nAct in this matter of representation, and had\nwe been told that we could have under that\nAct no representation, as I have heard argued,\nor only one member, we would have certainly\nsaid, \"Much obliged to you, we will remain a\nlittle longer as we are.\" (Hear, hear.) And\nnow with regard to\nTHE  RAILWAY  CIiAUSE\nof these terms. After all the rest of the\nscheme of union had been framed in Executive Council, it was unanimously agreed, and\nthis conclusion has been supported by the\nsentiment of the whole community, that\nthere could not be any real union with Canada without a material connection by the\nconstruction of a coach road first, to be followed at once by a railway. That was the\nconclusion arrived at by our Legislative\nCouncil in, 1870, and urged upon your Government by the British Columbia delegates\nas a sine qua non of our union. There was a\nvery great lack of confidence in Canada at\nthat time on the part of some members of the\nLegislative Council, and among the people of\nVictoria, not because those gentlemen, who\nwere nearly all Englishmen, had any leaning\ntowards the United States, but because they\nfeared that Canada was not in a position to\nundertake the construction of this material\nconnection by railway between British Columbia and this part of the Dominion. If\nCanada were not to make this connection,\nthen we might just as well seek union with\nAustralia or New Zealand (hear, hear.) If\nwe were only to become a mere isolated colony of Canada we had better remain as we\nwere, a separate colony of England. We argued \" If Canada is now ready to make\nthis railway, then let us join her at once,\nif not we shall do better to stay as we are\nuntil she is prepared to undertake the responsibility of that enterprise.\" We never\nthought of requiring the construction of this\nrailway as the price of our union with the\nDominion, but we\\had been told that Canada\nwas ready to build this railway, that it was a\n\t 8\npolitical and commercial necessity for her to\ndo so, and that she wanted British Columbia\nchiefly for the purpose of making this railway through our country to the Pacific.\nUnder these circumstances we were ready,\nwe were desirous of entering into this Confederation. In the early part of these remarks\nI told you that, we in British Columbia had\nbeen led to expect, from the utterances of her\npublic men and from the views expressed by\nher journalists, that the union of British\nColumbia with the Dominion would have\nmet with the hearty approval of Ontaria, that\nthe construction at once of the Canadian\nPacific Railway would meet with her ready\nsupport, and I intimated to you, Sir, that I\nknew that British Columbia would be, as I\nwas, astonished at the position taken by many\nmembers of Parliament from Ontario. And\nin support of that position I pray you to allow me to read to you an extract from the\nBritish Colonist of the 15th March, published\nin Victoria, which I received three days\nsince. In a leading article our Victoria editor\nwrites as follow:\n\" British Columbia owes much, to the Toronto\nGlobe for the force find ability with which It has\nall along pre*ssed upon the Dominion of Canada\nthe necessity mi adopting a broad, vigorous, and\ntruly national policy with respect to throwing\nopen the great North West and pressing onward\nto the Pacific. Our big contemporary is doubtless not altogether free from faults and failings,\nbut this one virtue ought t'» cover a multitude of\nsins, to the eye of British Columbia at least. In\narecent number of the Globe weflnda very able\nleading article upon the subject of the Canadian\nPacific Railway. Our contemporary alludes to\nthe argument so commonly put forward by our\nAmerican neighbours, viz., that the American\nNorthern Pacific Railway, running, as it do's\nnear the boundary line, and draining, as it wi'l,\nth? British ossessions lying to the north of the\nforiy-ninth parallel, must forever forbid the idea\nof a Canadian Pacific line proving a success, if,\nindeed it does not forbid the idea of such a line\never iwinsr built. To this our contemporary the\nGi> be well replied:—\nI may remark that the following extract is\nquoted by our editor verbatim from the To-\nr. nto Globe of the 3rd Februaiy, as I have\nascertained by reference to a file of that\njournal :\n\"T .'• main line of th» North Pacific at no\npoint of its rout,\" approaches within a hundred\nand fifty miles of British territory, while in general it is at a much greater distance from the\nboundary Imp. supposing our great lak^s blotted\nout, and a wilderness of a hundred and fifty\nmi es stretching along the whole border line of\nOntaria, would any one argue that a railway far\ndown in Pennsylvania and New York would be\nquite sufficient io developp the resources of this\ncountry, and that all Canadian lines would be\nreally so much money thrown away ? Yet such\nan argument would not be so foolish and inconclusive as what is urged against the construction\nof a great Canadian Trans-Continental Railway.\n\"The proposed route of that undertaking is, on\nan average, four hundred miles north of that\nbeing made from Duiuth, and instead of being,\nas a large part of both the American lines must\nbe. through an irreclaimable desert, it runs\nthrough a country which, in fertility and climate, will com pare favorably with any part of\nthe North American Continent.\n\"When this, has been stated, nothing else is necessary. Any person of ordinary intelligence\ncan see at. a glance that a railway which never,\nthroughout its whole course comes within a\nhundred miles of the borderline of a country,\ncan do very little to delevope the resources of\nI that country. It is better than nothing, but this\nis a'l that c^n be said in its behalf. Tne immediate territory through which it runs would be\nbenefitted chiefly, and in the first place and\nall beyond only incidentally, and after the lapse\nof many years.\n\"inst-ad of the fact that the North Pacific is\nunder construe ion being an argument for Blowing the Canadian project to lie in the meanwhile in abeyance, it affords the strongest reason possible for its being pushed throi gh without delay. Politically it is a manifest and pressing necessity, whilp commercially It is as evidently of the very highest importance for Canada. I n i his way alone can this country have\nany chance for her fair share in hjprative trade\nwith the North-west which will assuredly spring\nup, and in the varied traffic with the Pacfic\nworld which to a great extent will pa«s through\nI Canadian territory, if one; what will be the\nshortest and easiest route from ocean to ocean is\nin working order.\"\nThe British Columbia editor on this remarks :\n\"Our readers will agree with the foregoing,\nwhile they will most heartily en orse and enthusiastically applaud the following paragraph\nwith which the Globe's article concludes :\n\"Our neighbours know the value of the prize\ninvolved, and are making giganlie efforts to secure it exclusively for themselves, uur rulers\nwill be traitors to their country and to Bri ish\nconnection if they lose a single season in making\nit practicable and convenient for settlers to go\nto hort Garry through our own territory) and in\nputting things in a fair way for the Canadian\nPacific Railway. It is a question not merely of\nconvenience but of national existence. It must\nbe pushed through at whatever expense. W'e\nbelieve it can be so pushed through, ' not only\nwithout being a burden pecuniarily upon Canada, but with an absolute profit in every point of\nview. Without such a line a great British North\nAmerica would turn out an unsubstantial\ndream; with it, and with ordinary prudence\nrnd wisdom on the part of her statesmen, it\nwill be a great, a glorious, and inevitable reality.\"\nI cannot imagine any stronger argument\nin favour of the immediate construction of\nthe proposed railway, by even its most enthusiastically interested British Columbian\nadvocates, than that here urged by the editor\nof the Toronto Globe. This work which he\nso pressingly insists on as a political necessity, and as of the highest commercial importance, we proposed to you to undertake ;\nand this work you have engaged to commence\nat once, and to complete at the earliest practicable period, that is to say, as we have estimated, in ten year* from the date of union.\nTHE  TEN TEARS'  LIMITATION.\nAnd now, Sir, I speak with special care, as I\ndesire that full weight should be given to\nevery word I utter on this point, that is to\nsay, as- to the understanding which I had\nwhen this clause was framed, and still have;\nof the intention of this engagement by the\nDominion to construct the Canadian Pacific\nRailway within ten years. When we came\nto you in June last,,we proposed that you\nshould build'at once a coach road from Fort\nGarry to the Pacific, and within three years\nbegin! a railway, and we sought to bind you\nto spend a million of dollars annually on the\nsection of this railroad in British Columbia,\nand to complete its construction with the\nutmost possible despatch. We fully understood then that once the road was commenced, it must be urged to its completion\nraSfc as a matter of course, as a business necessity,\nand that instead of $1,000,000 being spent,\nprobably $5,000,000 would be yearly expended in British Columbia. We knew, in fact,\nthat if the road were to be completed at all,\nit would have to be proceeded with at a far\nfaster rate than a million a year would insure.\nBut there were those in British Columbia\nwho thought that Canada would not undertake the work at all, and it was to satisfy\ntheir doubts, to secure their adhesion to the\nscheme, that the guarantee of the expenditure of the $1,000,000 annually was asked.\nThe Government, on conference with our*\ndelegation, at once expressed their readiness\nto commence at once the railroad to the Pacific, and to complete it as soon as it was practicable to do so; but the coach road was objected to as an unnecessary expense, in view of the\nimmediate construction of a railroad. We\nfrom British Columbia were prepared to accept this amendment of the scheme, and wc\naccordingly proceeded to calculate the time\nit would probably take to build the railroad,\nand we agreed upon an estimated period of\nten years. If it had been put at twelve or\nfifteen years, British Columbia would\nhave been just as well satisfied,\nand if the estimated period had been reduced\nto eight years she would scarcely have been\nbetter pleased; but some definite period for\nthe completion of this work the British Columbia delegates insisted on as a necessary\nsafeguard to our colony in entering into the\nproposed union. To argue that any other\ninterpretation will be placed upon this railway engagement by British Columbia than\nthat which I have given to you as my construction of it,—to argue that she expects it\nto be carried out in the exact interpretation\nof the words themselves, regardless of all\nconsequences, is a fallacy which cannot bear\nthe test of common sense. (Hear, hear ) The\ncase stands thus : British Columbia is about\nto enter into a partnership with Canada, and\none of the terms of the articles of partnership is that we are under the partnership to\nconstruct a railway upon certain conditions.\nIs British Columbia going to hold her partner\nto that which will bring ruin and bankruptcy upon the firm? Surely you would\nthink us fools indeed if we adopted such a\ncourse. I would protest, and the whole of\nBritish Columbia would protest, if the government proposed to borrow $100,000,000 or\nS150,000,000 to construct this road; (hear,\nhear,) running the country into debt, and\ntaxing the people of British Columbia as well\nas of the rest of the Dominion to pay the\nburden of such a debt. Why, sir, I heard it\nsaid the other evening that British Columbia\nhad made a most Jewish bargain with you in\nthese terms, but even Shylock himself would\nnot exact his pound of flesh if a portion of it\nhad to be cut from his own body. (Lcud\ncheers and laughter.) I am sure that you\nwill find that British Columbia is a pretty\nintelligent community, which will be apt to\nfake a business view of this matter. She\nwill expect that this railway shall be com-\n1 menced in two years, for that is clearly\npracticable; and she will also expect that\nI the financial ability of the Dominion will be\nj exerted to its utmost, within the limits of\nreason, to complete it in the time named in\nthe agreement; but you may rest assured\nthat she will not regard this railway engagement as a \" cast-iron contract,\" as it has been\ncalled, or desire that it should be carried out\nin any other way than as will secure the\nprosperity of the'whole Dominion of which\nshe is to be a part. (Cheers.) I have understood this railway engagement in this way\nfrom the first, and I still so understand it.\nI believed when we negotiated this clause in\nthe terms of union last year, and I now believe, that it is not only practicable for this\nroad to be built by a liberal land grant and\na moderate money subsidy, but that it will\nbe so built and completed within the estimated period of ten years But if a mistake\nhas been made in this estimate, do not thiuk\nthat British Columbia is going to put a\nstrained interpretation upon the agreement,\nto her own material injury; that she is likely,\nas the saying is, to bite her own nose off to\nspite her face.\nESTIMATED  COST  OP THE RAILWAY.\nI will enter into no estimate to-night\nof the cost of the section of the proposed road east of the Rocky Mountains.\nYou have as good means of forming opinions\non the probable expenditure that will be required on this portion of the line as I have.\nBut I will speak of the probable cost of the\nline in British Columbia through a country\nwith which I am personally acquainted.\nBritish Columbia, Sii, is not such an unknown, unexplored country as it has been\nsupposed or represented to be. I may mention to you that in 1865 and 1866, in obedience to a despatch from the Secretary of\nState, asking for information regarding\nthe facilities for the construction of a\nwaggon road across the mountains, to connect with the Red River settlement, I instituted, under the Governor's direction, explo- !\nrations of the country between Fraser River\nand the Rocky Mountain range, and the report of these explorations, together wit^i.a\nminute from myself thereon, summing\nup all the information then obtainable,\nwere printed and have been made public.\nIt is, I think, pretty certain that the choice\nfor the line through the Rocky Mountains is\nbetween Leather Pass and Howse's Pass; but\nfrom the Western outlet of either of those\npasses, there are several lines of route to the\nPacific, and I do not prttend now to offer\nany opinion as to the relative merits of these\nseveral lines. I will speak only of that\none which I am most acquainted with, having passed over nearly this whole line from\nthe Pacific to the Rocky Mountains, on horseback or on foot, and over parts of it frequently. I mean a line from the mouth of the\nFraser, following up the course of that river\nand of one of its tributaries, the Thompson,\nto the head waters of the south branch of 10\nthe latter river, in Shuswap Lake, thence\nthrough the Eagle Pass across a summit of\nthe Gold Range, four hundred and seventy\nfeet above the Lake level to the Columbia\nRiver, and up the Columbia and one of its\nsmall tributaries, called Blackberry River, to\nHowse's Pass. This is not only a practicable\nline but it will give a gradual ascent to the\nsummit of the Rocky Mountains, from which\npoint the descent to the Red River will be\nalmost a regular incline, in very favorable\ncomparison with the grade of the road now\nin operatien between San Francisco and\nOmaha, which passes over four successive\nI summits, the lowest of which is two thou-\nr sand feet higher than that we have to over-\n1 come on the Rocky Mountains. Now, Sir,\nin the absence of detailed surveys and sections, no one can make a close estimate of\nthe cost of this line; but I venture to express my opinion in which I am supported by\nother gentlemen, like myself engineers, who\nhave gone over the line, that notwithstanding some portions of the work on this road\nalong the Canon of the Fraser would be\nvery expensive, the whole distance from the\nPacific seaboard to the summit of the Rocky\nMountains, a distance of about six hundred\nmiles, may be set down at an approximate estimate of  $60,000   per  mile.\nRESULT OP DEFEAT OP UNION.\nI have been frequently asked of late—and I\nmention this point as it has been discussed\nso warmly in Parliament. \" What would\nhave been the result in British Columbia had\nthe address in favor of her union with Canada\nbeen voted down ?\" Well, Sir, as I have\nsaid already this evening, the people of British- Columbia are not only an intelligent but\na loyal community—throughout the whole\ncountry there exists strong attachment to\n-British connection. They have never as a\npeople had any inclination for the United\nStates or any proclivity toward the institutions of that country; and though there-was\nat one time in the year before last an attempt\non the part of a few disaffected persons to\nraise such an issue, it was so speedily hooted\ndown thatthe very word annexation has\nbeen ever since taboed among us. But,\nhad this address not been carried there would\nhave been the deepest disappointment\nthroughout our colony and profound discouragement to the best friends there of Confederation. Our people have been given to\nunderstand from all quarters in Canada as I\nbefore told you that the Canadian Pacific\nRailway was to be built at once—they have\nregarded their union with Canada on the\nterms arranged by your'Goyernment as afore-\ngone conclusion—and had they been told by\nyou as they would in fact have been told by\nycur refusal to confirm those terms, \" we\nare not able to undertake the building of\nthis Railway, we are not prepared to take the\nresponsbility of uniting British Columbia\nto us, not equal to the occasion which presents itself,\" they would certainly with embittered   feelings have at once and unani\nmously refused to unite with you on any\nother terms, and what might have been the\nultimate rosult I would prefer not to conjecture. But, Sir, happily we have escaped any\nsuch risk as this would have occasioned to\nthe consolidation of British interests on this\ncontinent, and are met here to-night to rejoice over the consummation of the great\nwork of the union of British Columbia to the Dominion. (Cheers.)\nI must apologise for the length of these\nremarks on a social occasion such as this is,\nbut there were some points with regard to\nthe true bearing and intention of the terms\nof union of our colony with Canada which I\nhave considered it very desirable, not only\nfor the sake of our community, but\" in the\ninterest of this whole Dominion, to comment\non, and explain from a British Columbia\npoint of view, and I have availed myself of\nthis opportunity of doing so as I see no probability of any other being afforded me just\nnow. And now, sir, I beg to renew my acknowledgements of-the high compliment paid this\nevening to British Columbia in the person\nof her representative. For myself I can only\nassure you that I shall ever cherish a grateful recollection of the very great kindness\nwhich I have received from the many friends\nwith whom I have had the pleasure of becoming acquainted in Canada, and especially,\nMr. Chairman, from yourself. On behalf of\nthe people of British Columbia—the youngest of the fair sisterhood of federated provinces now spread across this broad continent\nfrom ocean to ocean—I express the heartfelt\ndesire—long may this goodly Dominion\nflourish and grow in honor among the nations under the dear old flag that now waves\nover us—enjoying year by year an increasing\nmeasure of material prosperity, and truest\nhappiness 1 and in direct connection with this\nsentiment I propose to you in the name of\nour colony a toast which I know needs no\nfurther preface here to-night—to those to\nwhom British Columbia and this whole Dominion owe so much—\" Her Majesty's Ministers.\"   (Loud and prolonged cheers.)\nThe toast having been enthusiastically\ndrank,\nSir G. E. Cartier, on behalf of his colleagues and himself, returned their most sincere thanks. With regard to this present\nministry it should be borne in mind that it\nwas the offspring of Confederation. From\nthe 1st of July, 1867, it had been the task of\nthe ministry ever to extend the incomplete\nscheme of Oonfederation. It was their happy lot to-day to see this in a measure completed.   (Hear, hear, and cheers.)\nHon. Mr. Campbell said that he was happy\nto submit to Sir George's response for the\nministry. He was sure they were all delighted that Sir George had been so happy in leading during the absence of Sir John. (Hear.)\nThe mottoe of the present ministry had ever\nbeen \" One Queen, one flag, one destiny.\"\n(Loud cheers.) That had been the feeling\nwhich had influenced them, and when they 11\npassed away, the result of that influence would\nremain forever. (Cheers.)\nHon. Dr. Tupper, alluded to the rapid\nstrides which had been made in this country.\nWho, he said, in 1867 would have dreamt\ntbat they would have been enabled to night\nto celebrate the admission of British Columbia into the union. (Cheers.) He would\nnot add a single word to what had been al\nready said by the leader of the Government.\nHe begged permission to offer a volunteer\ntoast that of \" our sister Province Manitoba,\"\n•the representatives of which they had for\nthe first time sitting with them at the\nfestive board.\nThe   toast having   been  enthusiastically\nhonoured,\nDr. Sohultz, who was warmly received on\nrising, said that as \" Manitoba\" was not on\nthe list of proposed toasts he had not expected to have had the honor to reply on behalf\nof the Province, a portion of which he had\nthe honor to represent. Still, since they had\nchosen to do honor to the Prarie Province,\nhe would say something on her behalf. He\nhad listened with a very great deal of plea-\nenre to the remarks of their honored guest,\nMr. Truteh, and he felt that hon. gentleman\nhad made out a very strong and very satisfactory case in favor of our newly acquired\nProvince of British Columbia. (Hear, hear.)\nHe felt especially pleased to meet Mr. Truteh\nen this festive occasion, because he felt tbat\nit would probably be the last time he could\nmeet him in friendship. (Laughter.) It\nwas quite evident to him that the two West-\nem Provinces were to be rivals, and that\nwhen he met Mr. Truteh on the floor of the\nHouse of Commons next year each one would\ninsist on the special advantages ,which his\nProvince offered, and that there would be an\nantagonism which he trusted would not result disastrously. (Laughter.) While they\nwere yet friends, therefore, he must congratulate the hon. gentleman who had setfbe-\nfore them so clearly the somewhat intricate\nstate of affairs in the Province he represent-\njed. Mr. Truteh had dwelt upon the wealth\nof British Columbia in its fisheries, its coal\nfields, its timber and its gold. Well, Manitoba had something to offer too, or rather\nwould have when its boundaries were extended. It had its fisheries not to be despised;\nit had its gold fields, though people could\nnot as yet pick up nuggets as in British Columbia. (Laughter.) Still there were those\nwho when washing the shining sands of the\nUpper Saskatchewan argued that on our side\nof the Rocky Mountains there existed the\nmatrix from which these golden grains had\ndrifted. What Manitoba however had chiefly\nto offer to the Dominion was agricultural re-|\nsources, homes to the immigrant, a yield of,\ngrain unequalled in any country. What British Columbia seemed to need was wealth—\nwhat Manitoba needed was population. He\nwas willing that Mr. Truteh should get for\nhis Province all the capitalists if he could\n•.secure for Manitoba that immigration which\nher natural resources gave her the right to\nexpect. He felt very hopeful about the future of his Province. Indeed since the acquisition of British Columbia he had begun\nto take very large views ; he was even beginning to think that the capitol was not central enough in the new Dominion. (Laughter.) He would not be surprised if many\nof us lived to see the Capitol removed to\nsome place in the valley of Sackatchewan\nnow occupied only by the roaming tribes of\nthat region. The only want which Manitoba\nhad besides population was communication,\nand it was with great pleasure he learned on\nhis arrival in Canada that the Pacific Railway had been legislated and determined\nupon. (Cheers.) He looked upon the acquisition of these western Provinces in the light\nof an investment, profitable if their resources\nwere developed, useless if not, and a Railroad was the only way to develop them. Without Railroad communication, he considered\nthe £300,000, expended for its purchase, the\ntwo million dollars spent to put down rebellion, and the proposed payment of $67,000 a\nyear for the support of its Government, as\njust so much means squandered, so much\nmoney sunk for no possible good. (Cheers.)\nHad we railroad communication, we couid\nenter the emigrant centres of the old world\nand fairly bid, and even outbid all competitors. Could we at a reasonable cost transport the emigrant into Manitoba, we could\noffer him 160 acres of better prairie land that\ncan be found in the Western States, free. We\ncan Offer him the fnll privileges of citizenship after three years residence, instead of\nthe five years insisted on further South. We\ncan offer him a country where taxes are\nscarcely known, where such necessaries of\nlife, as could not be produced on his own\nfields or manufactured by himself, can be\nbought at one-half the cost of those articles\nin the much lauded Western States Where,\nin addition he may expect an average yield\none-third greater than that of the most productive grain raising State of the Union.\n(Cheers.) Could we be assured of receiving\nsuch an immigration then, it seemed to\nhim that success is certain. It is all\nright for us, to have these Eastern Pro- ■\nvinces depleted for our benefit, but there\nis, in that, no substantial advantage to\nthe Dominion at large. To use the immense resources we must have increased population, and with that, will come wealth\nrapidly enough. We must in building up a\nnation not depend alone on our own population and the emigrant class of the British .\nIsles, we must have our share, a monopoly\neven, if we can get it, of that Scandinavian\nand German element which is building up the\nnation south of us. (Cheers.) In conclusion\nDr. Schultz thanked the assembly for the\ngood feeling they expressed towards Manitoba, he felt convinced that they would not\nfind that Province to be the weakest nor the\npoorest of that chain which now girdled the\ncontinent; and if this great scheme that we\nhave set on foot, this effort to establish on\n\t >*m\nthis continent a great and prosperous British\npower; if it should so unfortunately happen\nthat this scheme should be frustrated, this\nlaudable effort fail, he felt certain that its\nfailure will have to be ascribed to some other\ncause than a lack of natural resources, in\nthat Confederation which now extends from\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific and which embraces a territory greater than that of half\nthe Kingdoms of Europe, or that of our natural rivals, the United States.   (Cheers.)\nMr. Smith, M. P. for Selkirk, Manitoba,\nafter repeated calls, rose and said that, after\nwhat had fallen from the gentleman who had\npreceded him, there was little more to be\nsaid. As it had been determined that they\nwere to have a railway connection with this\ncountry, he would say something about the\nroute. It had been said that the route from\nFort Garry to Canada was almost impracticable. He believed, from what he could\nlearn from people who had traversed that\nroute, that this was not the case. (Hear,\nhear.) By following the old route taken by\nthe Hudson's Bay Company's officials, going\nbehind Nipissing, touching Nepigon, and\nskirting Lasalle, they would be able to pass\nthrough a country, certainly not quite equal\nto some portions of the Dominion, but, both\nas regarded climate and soil, not inferior to\nmuch of the country through which the Intercolonial Railway runs. At the Lake of the\nWoods they reached the prairie, which extended for fourteen hundred miles to the\nwestward, and afforded facilities for the construction of a railway unequalled by that\nthrough which any railway in the Dominion\npassed. (Hear, hear.) Then as to the resources of the country. They possessed large\nfisheries, and though they might not have a\nfish with the colour of a salmon, they had the\nwhite fish, which was far superior in flavour.\nThey, too, had found nuggets of gold, and\nthey were possessed of salt mines, which\nwere sufficient to supply the whole Dominion. There were large beds of coal, too,\non the Assiniboine and the Saskatchewan,\nand a great deal of coal oil somewhat\nnorth; and, besides, there were copper, iron, lead, &c, in abundance,\nand in the Pran River district they have a\ncountry quite equal to that of the Saskatchewan, and a climate which admitted of win\ntering herds of cattle out in the prairies,\nwhere they grazed throughout the whole\nyear, instead of being obliged to staUfeed\nthem for at least four months, as is the case\nboth in Ontario and Quebec (cheers). It had\nbeen supposed that the great difficulty in'\nManitoba was the lack of building material.\nBut the fact was that the shores of Lake\nWinnipeg would supply large quantities of\nexcellent granite and stone, and there were\nalso extensive beds of clay, which could be\nused for the manufacture of bricks, and during the last year a considerable quantity of\nbricks had been made. He thought, therefore, that for building material theyweie\npretty well off. (Hear, hear.) He believed\nthat during the coming years two steamers\nwould be running on Red River, for a distance of 160 miles, which would connect\nthat country with the railway system of the\nUnited States. On the Lake Manitoba (from\nwhich to Fort Garry the distance was only\nsixty miles over a perfectly level country)\nand the Saskatchewan River there would\ndoubtless also be steamers within a couple\nof years, thus to a certain extent opening up\nand giving the means of bringing down the\ncoal and other products of that extensive and\nvaluable district—but the great desideratum-\nwas railway communication; and he believed\nthat within the ten years spoken of the\nrailway would be built, and that the friends\nof those people who were going from Ontario\nand Quebec to Manitoba would not let the\nmatter rest, but would press forward as\nrapidly as possible the railway to the North\nWest.   (Loud cheers.)\nSir George Cartier then proposed the\nhealth of the speakers of the two Houses of\nParliament, regretting that domestic affliction\nprevented the attendance of the speaker of\nthe Senate.\nHon. Mr. Cockburn, Speaker of the House\nof Commons, responded in his usual happy\nfe train.\nThen followed \" the Press \" to which Mr..\nThomas White of the Gazette responded, and\n\"the ladies\" responded to by Mr. Savary. \"The\nchairman \" was proposed by Mr. Grant M.P.,\nand after the toast had been duly honoured,,\nthe band played God Save the Queen, and\nthe company separated.\nt",
